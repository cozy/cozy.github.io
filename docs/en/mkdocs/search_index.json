So you won\u2019t be able to run the connectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the following commands require root privileges. You can either open a root shell or use \nsudo\n when needed;\n\n\n\n\nPre-requisites\n\n\nCozy requires a CouchDB 2 database server, a reverse proxy and an SMTP server. We\u2019ll use Nginx in this tutorial but feel free to use your reverse proxy of choice.\n\n\nYou\nll also need a domain name and know how to associate all of its subdomains to the IP address of your server.\n\n\nInstall dependencies\n\n\nOn a fresh new Debian Stretch, here are the packages that may be useful to install and manage your server:\n\n\napt-get update \n apt-get --no-install-recommends -y install \\\n            ca-certificates \\\n            curl \\\n            net-tools \\\n            nginx \\\n            sudo \\\n            vim-tiny \\\n            build-essential \\\n            pkg-config \\\n            erlang \\\n            libicu-dev \\\n            libmozjs185-dev \\\n            libcurl4-openssl-dev\n\n\n\n\nInstall CouchDB\n\n\nDownload \nthe source code on CouchDB 2\n and \ninstall it\n.\n\n\ncd /tmp\ncurl -LO https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/couchdb/source/2.1.0/apache-couchdb-2.1.0.tar.gz\ntar xf apache-couchdb-2.1.0.tar.gz\ncd apache-couchdb-2.1.0\n./configure\nmake release\nadduser --system \\\n        --no-create-home \\\n        --shell /bin/bash \\\n        --group --gecos \\\n        \nCouchDB Administrator\n couchdb\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ll install CouchDB inside \n/home/couchdb\n:\n\n\ncp -R rel/couchdb /home/couchdb\nchown -R couchdb:couchdb /home/couchdb\nfind /home/couchdb -type d -exec chmod 0770 {} \\;\nchmod -R 0644 /home/couchdb/etc/*\nmkdir /var/log/couchdb \n chown couchdb: /var/log/couchdb\n\n\n\n\nFor now, we\u2019ll just run the database as a background job, but it is highly recommended to use some supervisor software.\n\n\nsudo -b -i -u couchdb sh -c '/home/couchdb/bin/couchdb \n /var/log/couchdb/couch.log 2\n /var/log/couchdb/couch-err.log'\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can setup a service script, and use systemd to run couchdb as a service :\n\n\ncat \nEOT \n /etc/systemd/system/couchdb.service\n[Unit]\nDescription=Couchdb service\nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nType=simple\nUser=couchdb\nExecStart=/home/couchdb/bin/couchdb -o /dev/stdout -e /dev/stderr\nRestart=always\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\nEOT\n\n\n\n\nThen to start and enable (start at boot) the service :\n\n\nsystemctl  daemon-reload\nsystemctl  start couchdb.service\nsystemctl  enable couchdb.service\n\n\n\n\nLast but not least, let\u2019s create the default databases:\n\n\ncurl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/_users\ncurl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/_replicator\ncurl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/_global_changes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f The default CouchDB installation has no admin user. Everybody can query the server. So, in production environment, make sure to create en admin user and update the CouchDB connexion URL inside the configuration file of Cozy.\n\n\n\n\nInstall the Cozy Stack\n\n\nThe Cozy server is just a single binary. You can fetch one of its releases from Github:\n\n\ncurl -o /usr/local/bin/cozy-stack \\\n     -L https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack/releases/download/2017M2-alpha/cozy-stack-linux-amd64-2017M2-alpha\nchmod +x /usr/local/bin/cozy-stack\nadduser --system \\\n        --no-create-home \\\n        --shell /bin/bash \\\n        --group --gecos \\\n          \nCozy\n cozy\nmkdir /var/log/cozy\nchown cozy: /var/log/cozy\nmkdir /var/lib/cozy\nchown -R cozy: /var/lib/cozy\n\n\n\n\nYou can configure your server using a JSON or YAML file. Let\u2019s fetch the sample configuration file:\n\n\nmkdir /etc/cozy\ncurl -o /etc/cozy/cozy.yaml \\\n     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cozy/cozy-stack/master/cozy.example.yaml\nchown -R cozy: /etc/cozy\n\n\n\n\nEdit this file to adapt it to your configuration. You should setup a directory to store the files. For example:\n\n\n  fs:\n    url: file://localhost/var/lib/cozy\n\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t forget to allow Cozy user to write inside this folder.\n\n\nCompile a recent stack\n\n\nThe released build may not contain the latest fixes. If you want an up to date version of the stack, you can compile it from the sources. This requires to install the Go compiler, fetch the sources and compile them:\n\n\napt-get --no-install-recommends -y install \\\n        ca-certificates \\\n        curl \\\n        net-tools \\\n        nginx \\\n        sudo \\\n        vim-tiny \\\n        build-essential \\\n        pkg-config \\\n        erlang \\\n        libicu-dev \\\n        libmozjs185-dev \\\n        libcurl4-openssl-dev \\\n        git\ncd /tmp\ncurl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.8.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz\ntar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.8.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz\nPATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin go get -u github.com/cozy/cozy-stack\ncp /root/go/bin/cozy-stack /usr/local/bin/cozy-stack\nchmod +x /usr/local/bin/cozy-stack\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nNGinx\n\n\nLet\u2019s assume you want to host a server on \nmycozy.tld\n with a self-signed certificate.\n\n\nGenerate the certificate. We need a wild-card certificate, as every application inside Cozy will have it\u2019s own sub-domain:\n\n\nsudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 \\\n    -keyout /etc/cozy/mycozy.tld.key \\\n    -out /etc/cozy/mycozy.tld.crt \\\n    -days 365 -subj \n/CN={*.mycozy.tld}\n\n\n\n\nThen create a virtual host for your server by creating a file at \n/etc/cozy/sites-available/mycozy.tld.conf\n with \nthe following configuration template\n.\nAnd enable it by creating a symbolic link:\n\n\nsudo ln -s \n/etc/nginx/sites-available/mycozy.tld.conf\n \\\n       /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/\n\n\n\n\nYou can check that your configuration is valid by running\n\n\nsudo nginx -t -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n\n\n\n\nAnd start NGinx:\n\n\nsudo service nginx start\n\n\n\n\nOr, if you use systemd:\n\n\nsudo systemctl start nginx\nsudo systemctl enable nginx # enable the nginx service at startup, if need to\n\n\n\n\nCozy\n\n\nThe Cozy server requires a main password:\n\n\nsudo /usr/local/bin/cozy-stack config passwd /etc/cozy/\n\n\n\n\nThis password will be asked every time you use the \ncozy-stack\n command line. To prevent this, you can set the \nCOZY_ADMIN_PASSWORD\n environment variable.\n\n\nDNS\n\n\nMake sure to associate \n*.mycozy.tld\n with the IP address of your server.\n\n\nFor example, add the following records to your DNS (replacing \nmycozy.tld\n with your domain of choice):\n\n\nmycozy.tld   A     your IP\n*.mycozy.tld CNAME mycozy.tld\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\nFor now, we\u2019ll just run the server as a background job, but it is highly recommended to use some supervisor software.\n\n\nFirst, start the server:\n\n\nsudo -b -u cozy sh -c '/usr/local/bin/cozy-stack serve \\\n     --log-level info \\\n     --host 0.0.0.0 \n /var/log/cozy/cozy.log 2\n /var/log/cozy/cozy-err.log'\n\n\n\n\nThen, create your instance and install the applications:\n\n\ncozy-stack instances add \\\n           --host 0.0.0.0 \\\n           --apps drive,photos,collect,settings \\\n           --passphrase \nXXX\n \\\n           mycozy.tld\n\n\n\n\n--passphrase \"XXX\"\n allows to set the initial password of the instance.\n\n\nYou can add other instances by just running this commands again.\n\n\n\n\nThe url of your cozy determines the name of your instance.\nIf you choose another public port than the default public port for SSL (443), say \n1443\n, then you should reflect this when creating your cozy instance with the ${instance_domain} as \nmycozy.tld:1443\n.\n\n\n\n\nSample configuration files\n\n\nNginx\n\n\nPut this file into \n/etc/nginx/sites-available\n and enable it by creating a symlink in \n/etc/nginx/sites-enabled\n.\n\n\nIn this template, you need to replace the following placeholders:\n\n\n\n\n%PORT% with the public port nginx will listen to (default should be 443)\n\n\n%SERVER_PORT% with the private port cozy will listen to (default should be 8080)\n\n\n%DOMAIN% with your domain of choice: \nmycozy.tld\n in this example\n\n\n\n\nserver {\n    listen %PORT%;\n\n    server_name *.%DOMAIN%;\n\n    ssl_certificate /etc/cozy/%DOMAIN%.crt;\n    ssl_certificate_key /etc/cozy/%DOMAIN%.key;\n    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;\n    ssl_session_timeout 10m;\n    ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;\n    ssl_ciphers EECDH+AES;\n    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;\n    ssl on;\n\n    gzip_vary on;\n    client_max_body_size 1024M;\n\n    add_header Strict-Transport-Security max-age=31536000;\n\n    location / {\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;\n        proxy_redirect http:// https://;\n        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;\n        proxy_http_version 1.1;\n        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n        proxy_set_header Connection \nupgrade\n;\n    }\n\n    access_log /var/log/nginx/cozy.log;\n}\n\n\n\n\nTODO\n\n\nCozy also requires a SMTP server (or relay).",

            "text": "How to create your first Cozy application\n\n\nPrerequisite\n\n\nDeveloping an application for Cozy is quite easy. All you need to know is:\n - how to develop a single page application in HTML5. You can use the tools or framework of your choice, or no framework\n - basic Docker knowledges.\n\n\nThe only required tool is Docker. We have been told that installing Docker on some familial flavours of Windows may be a bit difficult. If you use Windows, please check if Docker is available on your system.\n\n\nInstall the development environment\n\n\n\n\nOn GNU/Linux, according \nto the documentation\n: \u00ab\u00a0The docker daemon binds to a Unix socket instead of a TCP port. By default that Unix socket is owned by the user root and other users can only access it using sudo. If you don\u2019t want to use sudo when you use the docker command, create a Unix group called docker and add users to it. Be warned that the docker group grants privileges equivalent to the root user. You should have a look at \nDocker\u2019s documentation on security\n.\n\n\n\n\nEvery application running inside Cozy is a client-side HTML5 application interacting with your data through the API of the server. To develop an application, you\u2019ll require a running Cozy server.\n\n\nThe easiest way is to use the Docker image for developers we provide.\n\n\nJust install it:\n\n\ndocker pull cozy/cozy-app-dev\n\n\n\n\n(We update this image on a regular basis with the latest version of the server and our library. Don\u2019t forget to update the image by running \ndocker pull cozy/cozy-app-dev\n from time to time).\n\n\nCreate your first application\n\n\nThe minimal application consist of only two files:\n - an HTML file, \nindex.html\n, with the markup and the code of your application\n - a manifest describing the application. It\u2019s a JSON file named \nmanifest.webapp\n with the name of the application, the permissions it requires\u2026 We\u2019ll have a deeper look to it content later. #TODO add an inner link to the manifest description.\n\n\nYour application will be able to use some shared libraries provided by the server, so you don\u2019t have to include them into your project.\n\n\nYour application requires some informations to interact with the server API, for example the URL of its entrypoint, and an auth token. This data will be dynamically injected into \nindex.html\n when it serves the page. So the \nindex.html\n file has to contain some string that will be replaced by the server. The general syntax of this variables is \n{{\u2026}}\n, so don\u2019t use this syntax for other purpose in the page, for example inside comments.\n\n\nYou can use the following variables:\n\n\n\n\n{{.Domain}}\n will be substituted by the URL of the API entrypoint\n\n\n{{.Token}}\n will be replaced by a token that authenticate your application when accessing the API\n\n\n{{.Locale}}\n: the lang f the instance\n\n\n{{.AppName}}\n: the name of the application\n\n\n{{.IconPath}}\n will be replaced by HTML code to display the \nfavicon\n\n\n{{.CozyClientJS}}\n will be replaced with HTML code to inject the Cozy client library\n\n\n{{.CozyBar}}\n will be replaced with HTML code to inject the upper menu bar.\n\n\n\n\nUse the API\n\n\nIf you added \n{{.CozyClientJS}}\n to your page, interacting with the server will be as easy as using the Cozy Client JS library. All you have to do is to initiate the library with the server parameters (the URL of the API and the auth token of your application):\n\n\n  window.cozy.client.init({cozyURL: \n\u2026\n, token: \n\u2026\n});\n\n\n\n\nYou can then interact with the server by using methods of the \nwindow.cozy.client\n properties. For example, to get current disk usage:\n\n\n  cozy.client.settings.diskUsage()\n    .then(function (usage) {console.log(\nUsage (promise)\n, usage);});\n    .catch(function(err){ console.log(\nfail\n, err); });\n\n\n\n\nThis library embeds most of the available server APIs: manipulate documents and files, manage applications and server settings\u2026 It also provides some some methods to help application keep working while being offline.\n\n\nSome server APIs may not be available right now through the library. If you want to use one of this method, you\u2019ll have to call it manually. See below. #TODO - add inner link.\n\n\nBehind the magic\n\n\nSome server APIs may not be available right now through the library. If you want to use one of this method, you\u2019ll have to call it manually. We\u2019ll describe here how to access the API without using the Cozy Cliznt JS library.\n\n\nConnecting to the API requires three things:\n\n\n\n\nits URL, injected into the page through the \n{{.Domain}}\n variable\n\n\nthe application auth token, injected into the page through the \n{{.Token}}\n variable. Each request sent to the server must include this token in the \nAuthorization\n header\n\n\nthe session cookie, created when you connect to your server. This is an \nHttpOnly cookie\n, meaning that JavaScript applications can\u2019t read it. This prevent a malicious script to stole the cookie.\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a sample code that get API informations provided by the server and query the API:\n\n\n    \ndiv data-cozy-token=\n{{.Token}}\n data-cozy-domain=\n{{.Domain}}\n /\n\n\n\n\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () =\n {\n  \nuse strict\n;\n  const app = document.querySelector('[data-cozy-token]');\n  fetch(`//${app.dataset.cozyDomain}/apps`,\n  {\n    method: 'GET',\n    headers: {\n      Authorization: `Bearer ${app.dataset.cozyToken}` // Here we use the auth token\n    },\n    credentials: 'include' // don\u2019t forget to include the session cookie\n  })\n  .then(function (response) {\n    if (response.ok) {\n      response.json().then((result) =\n {\n        console.log(result);\n      });\n    } else {\n      throw new Error('Network response was not ok.');\n    }\n  })\n  .catch(function (error) {\n    console.log('There has been a problem with your fetch operation: ' + error.message);\n  });\n});\n\n\n\n\nThe manifest\n\n\nEach application must have a \u201cmanifest\u201d. It\u2019s a JSON file named \nmanifest.webapp\n stored at the root of the application directory. It describes the application, the type of documents it uses, the permissions it require\u2026\n\n\nHere\u2019s a sample manifest:\n\n\n{\n  \nname\n: \nMy Awesome application\n,\n  \npermissions\n: {\n    \napps\n: {\n      \ntype\n: \nio.cozy.apps\n\n    },\n    \npermissions\n: {\n      \ntype\n: \nio.cozy.permissions\n\n    },\n    \nsettings\n: {\n      \ntype\n: \nio.cozy.settings\n\n    },\n    \nsample\n: {\n      \ntype\n: \nio.cozy.dev.sample\n,\n      \nverbs\n: [\nGET\n, \nPOST\n, \nPUT\n, \nPATCH\n, \nDELETE\n]\n    },\n    \njobs\n: {\n      \ntype\n: \nio.cozy.jobs\n\n    }\n  },\n  \nroutes\n: {\n    \n/\n: {\n      \nfolder\n: \n/\n,\n      \nindex\n: \nindex.html\n,\n      \npublic\n: false\n    },\n    \n/public\n: {\n      \nfolder\n: \n/public\n,\n      \nindex\n: \nindex.html\n,\n      \npublic\n: true\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nPermissions\n\n\nApplications require permissions to use most of the APIs. Permissions can be described inside the manifest, so the server can ask the user to grant them during installation. Applications can also request permissions at run time.\n\n\nA permission must at type contain a target, the type of objects the application want to interact with. Can be a document type, or an action on the server. By default, all grant on this object are granted, but we can also request fine grained permissions, for example limiting to read access. We can also limit the scope to a subset of the documents.\n\n\nIn the manifest, each permission is an object, with a random name and some properties:\n\n\n\n\ntype\n: \nmandatory\n the document type or action name\n\n\ndescription\n: a text that will be displayed to the user to explain why the application require this permission\n\n\nverbs\n: an array of HTTP verbs. For example, to limit permissions to read access, use \n[\"GET\"]\n\n\nselector\n: a document attribute to limit access to a subset of documents\n\n\nvalues\n: array of allowed values for this attribute.\n\n\n\n\nAn application can request a token that grant access to a subset of its own permissions. For example if the application has full access to the files, it can obtain a token that give only read access on a file. Thus, the application can make some documents publicly available. The public page of the application will use this token as authentication token when accessing the API.\n\n\nSamples\n\n\nApplication require full access to files:\n\n\n{\n  \npermissions\n: {\n    \nfiles\n: {\n      \ndescription\n: \n\u2026\n,\n      \ntype\n: \nio.cozy.files\n\n    },\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nApplication want to be able to read the contact informations of \ncozy@cozycloud.cc\n\n\n{\n  \npermissions\n: {\n    \ncontact\n: {\n      \ntype\n: \nio.cozy.contacts\n,\n      \nverbs\n: [\nGET\n],\n      \nselector\n: \nemail\n,\n      \nvalues\n: [\ncozy@cozycloud.cc\n]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nRouting\n\n\nThe application must declare all of its URLs (routes) inside the manifest. A route is an object associating an URL to an HTML file. Each route has the following properties:\n\n\n\n\nfolder\n: the base folder of the route\n\n\nindex\n: the name of the file inside this folder\n\n\npublic\n: a boolean specifying whether the route is public or private (default).\n\n\n\n\nSample:\n\n\nroutes\n: {\n  \n/admin\n: {\n    \nfolder\n: \n/\n,\n    \nindex\n: \nadmin.html\n,\n    \npublic\n: false\n  },\n  \n/public\n: {\n    \nfolder\n: \n/public\n,\n    \nindex\n: \nindex.html\n,\n    \npublic\n: true\n  },\n  \n/assets\n: {\n    \nfolder\n: \n/assets\n,\n    \npublic\n: true\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\ncozy-client-js\n\n\nThis library embeds most of the available server APIs: manipulate documents and files, manage applications and server settings\u2026 It also provides some some methods to help application keep working while being offline.\n\n\nThe library expose a client API under the \nwindow.cozy.client\n namespace. Before using it, you have to initiate the library with the server parameters (the URL of the API and the auth token of your application):\n\n\n  window.cozy.client.init({cozyURL: \n\u2026\n, token: \n\u2026\n});\n\n\n\n\nThe library supports two programming paradigms: callback and Promises, so you can use your favorite one. If you prefer using callbacks rather than Promises, just add \ndisablePromises\n to the options when initializing the library:\n\n\n  window.cozy.client.init({cozyURL: \n\u2026\n, token: \n\u2026\n, disablePromises: true});\n  window.client.settings.diskUsage(function (err, res) {\n    (\u2026)\n  });\n\n\n\n\nRaw API documentation\n\n\nIn this tutorial, we\u2019ll only see a few samples of how to use the library. For a complete description of all available methods, please refer to its own documentation:\n\n\n\n\ndocuments\n\n\nfiles\n\n\nauthentification\n\n\nauthentication with OAuth2\n\n\nsettings\n\n\ninter-app communication\n\n\njobs and triggers\n\n\nsharing\n\n\noffline\n\n\nCozy Bar\n\n\n\n\nManipulating documents\n\n\nInside cozy data system, all documents are typed. To prevent applications to create document types with the same name but different description, the naming of the doctypes use \nthe Java specification\n. Every document type name must be prefixed by the reverted domain name of its creator. If you don\u2019t own a domain name, you can also use your email address. For example, doctypes created by Cozy are prefixed by \nio.cozy\n or \nio.cozy.labs\n. If you don\u2019t own a domain name, and your email address is \nfoo@bar.cloud\n, prefix your doctype names with \ncloud.bar.foo\n.\n\n\nBefore manipulating documents, you have to request permission to access their doctype, either in the manifest or dynamically.\n\n\nEvery method allowing to handle document are available under the \ncozy.client.data\n namespace. For example:\n\n\n\n\ncozy.client.data.create(doctype, attributes)\n, \ncozy.client.data.update(doctype, doc, newdoc)\n, \ncozy.client.data.delete(doctype, doc)\n to create, update and delete documents\n\n\ncozy.client.data.updateAttributes(doctype, id, changes)\n to only update some attributes of a document\n\n\ncozy.client.data.find(doctype, id)\n return a document using its ident\n\n\ncozy.client.data.changesFeed(doctype, options)\n get the latests updates of documents of a doctype.\n\n\nyou can attach files to a document using \ncozy.client.data.addReferencedFiles(doc, fileIds)\n and list attachments with \ncozy.client.data.listReferencedFiles(doc)\n.\n\n\n\n\nQuerying\n\n\nTo search documents inside the database, you first need to create an index on some attributes of the documents, then perform a query on this index. The library offers the following methods:\n\n\n\n\ncozy.client.data.defineIndex(doctype, fields)\n to create the index\n\n\ncozy.client.data.query(indexReference, query)\n to query an index. The query parameter uses the syntax of the \nMango API\n from CouchDB 2.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, to search contacts by their email address, you could use:\n\n\ncozy.client.data.defineIndex(\nio.cozy.contacts\n, [\nemail\n])\n.then((index) =\n {\n  return cozy.data.query(index, {\nselector\n: {email: \ncozy@cozycloud.cc\n}})\n})\n.then( (result) =\n {\n  console.log(result[0].name);\n});\n\n\n\n\nManipulating files\n\n\nThe metadata of the files are stored inside the server database, allowing to perform advanced queries, and the files themselves on a virtual file system.\n\n\nThe library offer a lot of methods under \ncozy.client.files\n namespace to manipulate files. Most of the methods allows to manipulate a file or folder either by its id or by its full path. Here are the most commons ones, but a lot of other methods are available in the \nraw API documentation\n:\n\n\n\n\ncreate()\n and \nupdateById()\n to create and update a file\n\n\ncreateDirectory()\n to create a folder\n\n\nupdateAttributesById()\n et \nupdateAttributesByPath()\n allow to update some metadata\n\n\nuse \ndestroyById\n to remove a file\n\n\na virtual trash is available. You can put files into the trash (\ntrashById()\n) and restore them (\nrestoreById()\n). You can also list the content of the trash (\nlistTrash()\n) and purge all trashed files (\nclearTrash()\n)\n\n\nstatById(id)\n et \nstatByPath(path)\n return the metadata and, or folders, their content\n\n\n\n\nFolders\n\n\nWhen using \nstatById()\n or \nstatByPath()\n to get metadata of of folder, you can than call \nrelations()\n on the resulting object to access their content. For example, to list content of the root folder, use:\n\n\ncozy.client.files.statByPath(\n/\n)\n.then((dir) =\n {\n  console.log(dir.relations(\ncontents\n));\n})\n\n\n\n\nSome special folder have a pre-defined id that will never change:\n\n\n\n\nio.cozy.files.root-dir\n is the root of the filesystem\n\n\nio.cozy.files.trash-dir\n is the trash.\n\n\n\n\nThe Cozy Bar\n\n\nThe \nCozy Bar\n is a component that display the Cozy menu on the top of your application and allow inter-apps features like content sharing.\n\n\nYour application interacts with this component through \ncozy-bar.js\n, a library injected into your pages by the server when you add \n{{.CozyBar}}\n in the header. It exposes an API behind the window.cozy.bar namespace.\n\n\nBefore using it, you have to initialize the library: \nwindow.cozy.bar.init({appName: \"Mon application\"})\n.\n\n\nStyling\n\n\nIf you plan to build a webapp to run on Cozy, you\u2019ll probably want to use a simple and elegant solution to build your interfaces without the mess of dealing with complex markup and CSS. Then \nCozy UI\n is here for you!\n\n\nIt relies on Stylus as preprocessor. You can add it as a library in your project to use it out-of-the-box.\n\n\nStart the development server\n\n\nNow it\u2019s time to start the development server, to test our application.\n\n\n(remember what we previously said about the permissions required to run Docker: if your user doesn\u2019t belong to the docker group, you\u2019ll have to use \nsudo\n to run each of this commands.)\n\n\nTo run your application inside the development server, just run the following command from the folder where your \nindex.html\n and \nmanifest.webapp\n files leave:\n\n\ndocker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -p 5984:5984 -p 8025:8025 -v $(pwd):/data/cozy-app --name cozydev cozy/cozy-app-dev\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s have a quick look at this command, so you can adapt it to your needs:\n\n\n\n\n--rm\n will delete the server when you stop it. This prevent Docker from keeping a lot of unused stopped images\n\n\n-it\n allow to attach an interactive terminal, so you\u2019ll be able to use the command line inside the server\n\n\n-p 8080:8080\n: the server listens on port 8080 on the virtual machine. We forward this port to the same port on your local machine. To use another local port, for example 9090, use \n-p 9090:8080\n\n\n-p 5984:5984\n: this is just a convenient way to access the CouchDB database running inside the server. Point your browser to \nhttp://cozy.tools:5984/_utils/\n to access its administrative interface\n\n\n-p 8025:8025\n\u00a0: Cozy requires a mail server. In the development image, we don\u2019t use a real email server, but a software that can display the sent messages. Just point your browser to \nhttp://cozy.tools:8025/\n to display the messages sent by the server\n\n\n-v $(pwd):/data/cozy-app\n this mount the current folder, where your application leaves, inside the server. This is what make the application available on the server\n\n\n--name cozydev\n name the running virtual machine \ncozydev\n, so you can easily refer to it from other Docker commands. For example, if you want to connect to a shell inside the server, you can use \ndocker exec -ti /bin/bash\n.\n\n\n\n\nWith this syntax, there is no data persistance: all your test data will be lost every time you stop the server. This is a good way to prevent side effects and start on a clean base, with an empty database.\n\n\nHowever, if you want to persist data, you have to mount two folders from the virtual server to local folders: \n/usr/local/couchdb/data\n (database) and \n/data/cozy-storage\n (the virtual filesystem). This can be achieved by adding to the command line \n-v ~/cozy/data/db:/usr/local/couchdb/data -v ~/cozy/data/storage:/data/cozy-storage\n which will store the server\u2019s data into \n~/cozy/data\n.\n\n\nOnce the server started, go to \nhttp://app.cozy.tools:8080/#\n, connect to the server with the default password \ncozy\n and you should be able to start testing your application.\n\n\nYou can also access the following URLs:\n\n\n\n\nhttp://cozy.tools:5984/_utils\n to get the database administrative panel\n\n\nhttp://cozy.tools:8025/\n to display the emails sent by the server.\n\n\n\n\nTest multiple applications\n\n\nYou can install more than one application into the development server, for example to test communication between applications. In order to achieve this, you have to mount the folder where your application leaves into subfolders of \n/data/cozy-apps\n. For example, if the code of Cozy Drive and Cozy Photos is on your local filesystem in \n~/cozy/drive\n and \n~/cozy/photos\n, start the development server with:\n\n\ndocker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -p 5984:5984 -p 8025:8025 -v \n~/cozy/drive\n:/data/cozy-app/drive\n -v \n~/cozy/photos:/data-cozy-app/photos\n --name=cozydev cozy/cozy-app-dev\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll access the applications by connecting to \nhttp://drive.cozy.tools:8080/\n and \nhttp://photos.cozy.tools:8080\n.\n\n\nTODO\n\n\nCe serveur de d\u00e9veloppement utilise les noms de domaine \n*.cozy.tools\n.

To run your application inside the development server, just run the following command from the folder where your  index.html  and  manifest.webapp  files leave:  docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -p 5984:5984 -p 8025:8025 -v $(pwd):/data/cozy-app --name cozydev cozy/cozy-app-dev  Let\u2019s have a quick look at this command, so you can adapt it to your needs:   --rm  will delete the server when you stop it.

Just point your browser to  http://cozy.tools:8025/  to display the messages sent by the server  -v $(pwd):/data/cozy-app  this mount the current folder, where your application leaves, inside the server.

For example, if you want to connect to a shell inside the server, you can use  docker exec -ti /bin/bash .   With this syntax, there is no data persistance: all your test data will be lost every time you stop the server. This is a good way to prevent side effects and start on a clean base, with an empty database.  However, if you want to persist data, you have to mount two folders from the virtual server to local folders:  /usr/local/couchdb/data  (database) and  /data/cozy-storage  (the virtual filesystem).

Once the server started, go to  http://app.cozy.tools:8080/# , connect to the server with the default password  cozy  and you should be able to start testing your application.

            "text": "How to write a connector\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nNew! Want an interactive tutorial on how to create a connector? Try \nthis one\n:\n\n\nA connector is a small script that allows to import data from an external website. Each connector is an independent application, managed by the Cozy Collect application.\n\n\nTo protect your data, each connector runs inside a sandbox where all their interactions with your data are under control.\n\n\nFrom a technical point of view, connectors are Node.js applications executed inside a container. They communicate with the server using its API, like client side apps, and get an auth token every time they start. They need to register with a manifest, and ask permissions to the user.\n\n\nTo ease the development of a connector, an npm package, named \ncozy-connector-libs\n provides a lot of\nshared libraries. But you may need some other npm packages to help you running your connector: \n\n\n\n\ncheerio\n to manipulate the DOM on remote web pages\u00a0\n\n\nmoment\n to manage dates\u00a0\n\n\nrequest\n for fetching remote URLs\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nWhen the application is started, it also gets some data through environment variables:\n\n\n\n\nCOZY_CREDENTIALS\n\u00a0: the auth token used by \ncozy-client-js\n to communicate with the server\u00a0\n\n\nCOZY_URL\n\u00a0: the API entry point\u00a0\n\n\nCOZY_FIELD\n\u00a0: the settings specific to each connector, for example the path of folder where the user wants to store the remote files\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nBut the base connector (\nrequire('cozy-konnector-libs').baseKonnector\n) in cozy-konnector-libs handles these for you.\n\n\nThe application can access a temporary file system, deleted at the end of its execution. Its logs (standard and error output) are kept by the server.\n\n\nFrom the server point of view, each connector is a \njob\n run through a \ntrigger\n.\n\n\nLet\u2019s create our first connector\n\n\nThe easiest way to create a new connector is to use \nour template\n:\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/cozy/cozy-konnector-template\ncd cozy-konnector-template\nyarn # or npm install\n\n\n\n\nnote: the Cozy Team uses \nyarn\n, but if you prefer \nnpm\n, just keep using it, everything should just work.\n\n\nThen, write your code into \nkonnectors.js\n and build the application, running \nyarn build\n or \nnpm run build\n.\n\n\nCollector structure\n\n\nBasically, a connector is just an object passed to baseKonnector.createNew:\n\n\n\n\nfetchOperations\n: array of methods that will be called sequentially to fetch the data\n\n\n\n\nTo create the connector, just call \nbaseKonnector.createNew()\n from the Cozy Collector lib, with an object describing the connector:\n\n\nconst {baseKonnector, filterExisting, saveDataAndFile, models} = require(\ncozy-konnector-libs\n);\nconst Kitten = models.baseModel.createNew({\n  name: \nkitten\n\n});\n\nmodule.exports = baseKonnector.createNew({\n  name: \nkitten\n,\n  models: [],\n  fetchOperations: [\n    fetchKittens,\n    customFilterExisting,\n    customSaveDataAndFile\n  ]\n});\n\n\n\n\nFetch operations\n\n\nEvery time the connector is run, it will call every method from the \nfetchOperations\n array. Use this methods to log into the remote site, fetch data and save it.\n\n\nEach function must use the same signature: \nfunctionName(fields, bills, data, next)\n where:\n\n\n\n\nfields\n are the values of the optional configuration fields\n\n\nentries\n is an object to pass data from one function to the next one\n\n\ndata\n allows to pass raw data from one function to the next one\n\n\nnext\n is a function to call to execute next function. One may pass an error as first argument. Don\u2019t forget to call it at the end of every step.\n\n\n\n\nA basic connector workflow involves:\n - getting data and storing them into \nentries.fetched\n. You can get the data by calling an API, scraping the remote website\u2026\n - filtering data to remove the ones already present inside the database. The filtered data will be put into \nentries.filtered\n\n - save the filtered data into the database.\n\n\nMany operations are common to most of the connectors, so we created some common functions you can import from the shared library. Most of the time, you\u2019ll just have to take care of fetching data, store them into \nentries.fetched\n then use the common methods to filter and save them.\n\n\nWe\u2019ll have a deeper look at this methods below.\n\n\nError handling\n\n\nIf your connector hit some issue fetching or saving the data, it can return an error code by passing it to the \nnext\n method. Some error code are defined inside the Cozy Collect application and will display an explicit error to the user:\n\n\n\n\nLOGIN_FAILED\n: the konnector could not login\n\n\nNOT_EXISTING_DIRECTORY\n: the folder specified as folder_to_save does not exist (checked by base_konnector)\n\n\nUNKNOWN_ERROR\n: there was an unexpected error, please take a look at the logs to know what appened\n\n\n\n\nKonnector lib\n\n\nThe Cozy Konnector Lib provide some useful methods for common tasks:\n\n\n\n\nbaseKonnector.createNew()\n: create the connector and fetch data\n\n\ncozyClient\n gives an instance of cozy-client-js already initialized according to COZY_URL, and\n   COZY_CREDENTIALS\n\n\nfetcher\n is the internal class that run fetching operations in sequence, calling the functions with the right parameters\n\n\nlog(type, message)\n allows to log messages\n\n\nmanifest\n extracts informations from the manifest (mainly used internaly at the moment)\n\n\nnaming\n is a method allowing to build file names according to parameters\n\n\nfilterExisting\n to filter data\n\n\nlinkBankOperation\n to link a bill to a bank operation\n\n\nsaveDataAndFile\n save the data\n\n\nupdateOrCreate\n create or update documents inside database\n\n\n\n\nThere are also some models available in require(\ncozy-konnector-libs\n).models :\n\n\n\n\nbaseModel\n : which is a model from which your model can extend using it\ns \ncreateNew\n method.\n   It offers the \nall\n, \ncreate\n, and \nupdateAttributes\n methods already implemented.\n\n\nbill\n : Offers an already implemented model allowing to manipulate \nio.cozy.bills\n doctype. It is used by many connectors.\n\n\nfile\n : a helper to manipulate files\n\n\nfolder\n : a helper to manipulate folders\n\n\nbankOperation\n : a helper to manipulate bank operations\n\n\n\n\nCommon methods\n\n\n cozyClient() \n\n\nIf you want to access cozy-client-js directly, this method gives you directly an instance of it,\ninitialized according to COZY_URL and COZY_CREDENTIALS environment variable.\nYou can refer to the \ncozy-client-js documentation\n for more information.\n\n\nconst {clientClient} = require('cozy-konnector-libs')\n\ncozyClient.data.defineIndex('my.doctype', ['_id'])\n\n\n\n\n filterExisting(log, model, suffix, vendor) \n\n\nThis method returns a fetch function that filter data fetched from the remote site to only keep the ones that don\u2019t exist in database. The fetched data are expected to be in the \nentries.fetched\n array. The resulting array will be put into \nentries.filtered\n\n\nParameters:\n\n\n\n\nlog\n: unused (kept for retro-compatibility)\n\n\nmodel\n: the model\n\n\nsuffix\n: unused (kept for retro-compatibility)\n\n\nvendor\n: if a vendor parameter is given, entry should be of given vendor to be added to the hash (useful for bills).\n\n\n\n\nkonnector.fetchOperations = [ (\u2026), customFilterExisting, (\u2026) ];\n\nfunction customFilterExisting(requiredFields, entries, data, next) {\n  filterExisting(myKonnector.logger, Bill) (requiredFields, entries, data, next);\n}\n\n\n\n\n saveDataAndFile(logger, model, options, tags) \n\n\nThis method returns a fetch function that creates an object in database for each item in \nentries.filtered\n array. If item has a \npdfurl\n attribute, the remote file will be downloaded and stored on the filesystem. \npdfUrl\n can point to any file, not necessarily a PDF file. The name comes from legacy code and has not been updated.\n\n\nParameters:\n\n\n\n\nlog\n: unused (kept for retro-compatibility)\n\n\nmodel\n: the model\n\n\noptions\n:\n\n\ntags\n: array of tags to apply to created files.\n\n\n\n\n updateOrCreate(logger, model, filter, options)` \n\n\nThis method return a fetch function that creates or updates an object in database for each item in the \nentries[model.displayName]\n array. The filter parameters specifies the fields used to find the document inside the database.\n\n\nParameters:\n\n\n\n\nlog\n: unused (kept for retro-compatibility)\n\n\nmodel\n: the model\n\n\nfilters\n: an array of fields names\n\n\ntags\n: array of tags to apply to created files.\n\n\n\n\n linkBankOperation \n\n\nThis method returns a fetch function that will try to link a bill to a bank operation. For each data item from \nentries.fetched\n, it will look for an operation that could match this entry. Once found, it attaches a binary to the bank operation. It\u2019s the same binary that is attached to the corresponding file object.\n\n\nThe criteria to find a matching operation are:\n\n\n\n\nOperation label should contain one of the identifiers given in parameter\n\n\nThe date should be between (bill date - \ndateDelta\n) and (bill date + \ndateDelta\n). Where \ndateDelta\n is given as a parameter and is in days\n\n\nThe amount should be between (bill amount - \namountDelta\n) and (bill amount + \namountDelta\n). Where \namountDelta\n is given as a parameter.\n\n\n\n\nParameters:\n\n\nYou should pass parameters as an object whose keys are:\n\n\n\n\nlog\n: unused (kept for retro-compatibility)\n\n\nmodel\n: a model object to check for.\n\n\nidentifier\n: a string or an array of strings to look for in the operation label (case insensitive: the layer will automatically set it to lowercase).\n\n\ndateDelta\n: the number of days allowed between the bank operation date and the bill date  (15 by default). \n\n\namountDelta\n: the difference between the bank operation amount and the bill amount (useful when the currency is not the same) (0 by default).\n\n\nisRefund\n: boolean telling if the operation is a refund or not. By default, it is \nfalse\n. Allows to match only operations with positive amount if set to \ntrue\n.\n\n\n\n\nCommon data models\n\n\nThe library includes the most used data model, so you can just require them if you need them:\n\n\n\n\nbankOperation\n\n\nbill\n\n\nfile\n\n\nfolder\n\n\n\n\nThe library also provide a \nbaseModel\n class to create your own data model. Each model inherits from the following methods:\n\n\n\n\nall(callback)\n fetch all documents\n\n\ncreate(entry, callback)\n creates a new document\n\n\nupdateAttributes(id, changes, callback)\n update the attributes of a document.\n\n\n\n\nconst { models: { baseModel } } = require(\u2019cozy-konnector-libs\u2019)\n\nmodule.exports = baseModel.createNew({\n    displayName: \nmyModel\n,\n    name: \nme.cozy.mymodel\n\n});\n\n\n\n\nThe manifest\n\n\nEach connector is described by a Manifest.

Each connector is an independent application, managed by the Cozy Collect application.  To protect your data, each connector runs inside a sandbox where all their interactions with your data are under control.  From a technical point of view, connectors are Node.js applications executed inside a container. They communicate with the server using its API, like client side apps, and get an auth token every time they start. They need to register with a manifest, and ask permissions to the user.  To ease the development of a connector, an npm package, named  cozy-connector-libs  provides a lot of\nshared libraries. But you may need some other npm packages to help you running your connector:    cheerio  to manipulate the DOM on remote web pages\u00a0  moment  to manage dates\u00a0  request  for fetching remote URLs\u00a0   When the application is started, it also gets some data through environment variables:   COZY_CREDENTIALS \u00a0: the auth token used by  cozy-client-js  to communicate with the server\u00a0  COZY_URL \u00a0: the API entry point\u00a0  COZY_FIELD \u00a0: the settings specific to each connector, for example the path of folder where the user wants to store the remote files\u00a0   But the base connector ( require('cozy-konnector-libs').baseKonnector ) in cozy-konnector-libs handles these for you.  The application can access a temporary file system, deleted at the end of its execution. Its logs (standard and error output) are kept by the server.
