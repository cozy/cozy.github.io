# Installing CouchDB

Cozy-stack uses couchdb to store structured data of your cozy.

Preferred installation method is precompiled package. In case there is no package yet for your system, you can also install couchdb using snap package (see instructions linked below).

- [Install CouchDB from precompiled package](./couchdb-pkg.md) (Debian 10, 11 or 12 / Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04)
- [Install CouchDB from snap package](./couchdb-snap.md)

If neither method is available for your particular system and architecture, refer to [CouchDB official installation documentation](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/install/unix.html) to build it from source.
