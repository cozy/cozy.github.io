#### Validation and release

###### Existing konnector modification or corrections

To validate your modifications on an existing konnector, you must create a GitHub Pull Request on the master branch of the original repository in our [konnector's organisation](https://github.com/konnectors) . We will review your work, potentially ask for clarifications, minor changes if needed and we will test it. Once everything looks good, we'll merge your branch into the master and release a new version with your modifications. We will handle everything after the merge, but you will remain the owner of those modification commits.

###### New konnector

If you have built a konnector that doesn't exist yet in the twake library, you should submit it through [Libera chat](https://web.libera.chat/#cozycloud) . Once tested on our side, you will need to transfer it to the `konnectors` organization. That way it can be part of the continuous deployment chain, with CI, library updates etc . We will do what is necessary to make it available in the application store so anyone can install it.
After that, we will give you access to the `konnectors` organization so you can maintain your CliSK, and we will display your name in the store (the one you provided in the manifest of the konnector) as the owner of this konnector.
