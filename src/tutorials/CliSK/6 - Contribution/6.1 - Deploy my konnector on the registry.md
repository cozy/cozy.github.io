#### Validation and release

###### Existing konnector modification or corrections

To validate your modifications on an existing konnector, you must have made a GitHub Pull Request on the master of the original repo in our [konnector's organisation](https://github.com/konnectors) . We will review your work, maybe ask for clarifications, little changes if needed and we will test it. Then when everything looks good, we'll merge your branch into the master and release a new version with your modifications. We will handle everything after the merge, but you will still be the owner of those modifications commits.

###### New konnector

If you had built a konnector that don't exist yet in the cozy library, you should submit it through [the contributor communication channel - TODO]() . Once tested on our side, you will need to transfer it to the `konnectors` organisation. That way it can be part of the continuous deployment chain, with CI, libraries updates etc ... we will do the necessary to make it available in the application store so anyone can install it.
After that, we will give you access to the `konnectors` organisation so you can maintain your CliSK, and we will display your name in the store (the one you gave in the manifest of the konnector) as the owner of this konnector.
