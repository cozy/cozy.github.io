##### What is a CliSK (Client-Side Konnector) ?

A CliSK is a type of konnector using a webview to simulate a browser into the Twake App. It's allowing the developer to interact directly on the website via a script or by giving back the control to the user when needed. Very useful to bypass bot detection by inducing a real human interaction on the website on sensible phases such as login, 2FA or any type of captcha.
