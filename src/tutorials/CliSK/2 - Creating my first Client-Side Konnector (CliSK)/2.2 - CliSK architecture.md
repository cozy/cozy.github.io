##### How it works ?

The CliSK contains two webviews. 
- One called `pilot`
- Second called `worker`
We will use those name during the tutorial, as it is part of mandatory understanding to make your konnector.

###### Pilot
The `pilot` webview is here to ensure the communication between the worker (navigating the web) and the Cozy App. It "pilots" (clever, right ?) the worker's actions and give back the result to the Cozy App.
###### Worker
The `worker` webview is like a very simple browser. It will navigate, interact, fill, scrap, intercept requests ... Pretty much the big part of the execution. It will return everything to the `pilot` in the end. That's the one you will be seeing when developing your konnector. 
###### Store
It allows the developer to store data if needed like request's responses with interesting data, or scraped data that will be useful further down the execution
###### Library
The used library for CliSK development is the [cozy-clisk](https://github.com/konnectors/libs/tree/master/packages/cozy-clisk) library.
We will cover it all in a dedicated documentation [TODO](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian%20Vault&file=Cozy%2FDocumentation%20Contributeurs%2FCozy-clisk%20library)
