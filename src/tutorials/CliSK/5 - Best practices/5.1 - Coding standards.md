A yarn script is provided to lint the code. It will respect most of our coding standards. Simply use the `yarn lint --fix` command

#### Logs

Regarding the logs you might put in your code, it is recommended to avoid logging sensible information once the konnector is ready to go to production.
It might me obvious but better safe than sorry.

On the other hand, keep it simple and practical. For debug purpose, it's good to have a starting log at the beginning of each _main_ functions, just to track possible bugs more efficiently. You can use the common type of log such as :

- `info` , to keep track of the execution steps, state of a page or anything worth seeing during the execution like number of found files for example
- `debug`, only visible when the instance is in debug mode once in production. Could be used to have a better overview of what is happening during the execution without polluting the log flow.
- `error` , to -of course- clearly show an error as occurred. However it is rarely used in production as we will prefer to throw an error with the JS native `throw new Error()` . It will stop the execution of the konnector if a critical error show up like a website maintenance.

```javascript
// info
this.log("info", "This is an info log");

// debug
this.log("debug", "This is a debug log");

// error
this.log("error", "This is an error log");
throw new Error("Error that stops the execution");
```
