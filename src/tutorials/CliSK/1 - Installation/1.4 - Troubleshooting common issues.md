##### Cozy Application logs

To troubleshoot some issues you may have, you can check the logs into the terminal tab where Metro is running (the one where you used the `yarn start` command).

##### Chrome/Chromium inspector

To access both of the webviews, you will need to use the chrome inspector and open the wanted webview. It will usually be the `worker`'s webview but know you can access the `pilot`'s from here too. It is accessible from `chrome://inspect/#devices`.
