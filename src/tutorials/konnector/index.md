A connector (also known as _konnector_) is a script that imports data from another web service and put those data into your cozy.
Each connector is an independent application, managed by the [Cozy Home][] application.

To protect your data, each connector runs inside a container in order to sandbox all their interactions with your data.

> ⚠️ For historical reasons, in the Cozy codebase, a cozy connector is named konnector, please follow this convention if modifying an existing application.
