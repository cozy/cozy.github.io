## Configuration

At the end of the installation, application will start and ask you for a few informations:

* Your Cozy URL. In other words, the address used to access to your Cozy.
* Your Cozy password. We don’t save your password, we only use it to create a new device login which it uses to synchronize your files.
* The folder where you want to synchronize your files.
