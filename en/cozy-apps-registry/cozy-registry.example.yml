# List of virtual spaces.
#
# A virtual space is a read-only view on another space with a filter to
# restrict the list of available applications. For example, we can use a
# `select` filter to create a virtual space with just a few applications, or a
# `reject` filter to have all the connectors and webapps, but not the google
# and facebook connectors.

#   registry3:
#     source: __default__
#     filter: select
#     slugs: ['home', 'settings', 'drive', 'contacts', 'store']
