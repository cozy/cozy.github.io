Release $VERSION

- [ ] Create branch and the PR with the following content
- [ ] Check to remove flags for features on which we are mature enough
- [ ] Run E2E tests (`yarn test:e2e`)
- [ ] Bump `manifest.webapp`, `config.xml`. Check the details below for Android's `versionCode`, `ios-CFBundleVersion`. ⚠️ Don't forget `AppendUserAgent`.
- [ ] Bump version in master for beta/prod versions not to shadow the next versions
- [ ] Commit and tag with a beta tag (X.Y.Z-beta.M)
- [ ] Check connector list to update banking connectors (src/utils/triggers)
- [ ] Push the tag and wait for the CI to push the beta version to the registry
- [ ] Push and check with a cozy from production (which has to be on the beta track for Banks)
- [ ] Release the app on Testflight for iOS. `yarn ios:publish`
- [ ] Release the app on Play Store on `beta` track. `yarn android:publish`
- [ ] Test well on the 3 platforms
- [ ] Tag the branch as prod (X.Y.Z)
- [ ] Push the tag, wait for the CI to push the build to the registry
- [ ] [Promote Android app][playstore] to the production track
- [ ] [Promote iOS app][itunesconnect] to the production track.

#### How to bump versions

At the **start** of the release process

1. Bump the `version` number in `package.json` and `config.xml` according to semver.
2. Copy this version to the `ios-CFBundleVersion` attribute and add a fourth number `.1` (then `.2` for the next beta version etc..)
3. For `android-versionCode`, follow this formula `beta + patch*100 + minor * 10000 + major * 1000000`.
4. Update the version number for the `AppendUserAgent` preference in `config.xml`.

At the **end** of the release process

For iOS you can simply remove the suffix and rebuild/reupload.
For Android, you have nothing to do, and can simply promote the build to the production track.

#### Why not let Cordova manage this automatically ?

The difficulty is that for stores (both PlayStore and iTunesConnect), you cannot have build with the same versionCode (for
Android) or ios-CFBundleVersion (for iOS). Normally those two numbers are managed by Cordova automatically (computed from the `version` attribute) but this
does not work well if during the release process (after having pushed a beta build in Testflight/PlayStore), you want to put a new version (because you have detected bug). If you let Cordova manage this, you would have to change the `version` from your config.xml and your `package.json`, and your production users would see a jump of version.

#### Android versionCode

The android-versionCode has to be a integer. But it has to be related to the `versionName` for debugging/understand purposes. Cordova does patch + minor *100 + major * 10000 but it does not leave space for beta versions (that have the same `versionName`). This is why we go one step further : `beta + patch *100 + minor * 10000 * major * 1000000). 0.7.6-beta1 is then `700601`. This number is not visible to the users, it's `android-versionName` that is visible and it's copied from `version` automatically Cordova.

#### ios-CFBundleVersion

For iOS, this is a little bit better since `ios-CFBundleVersion` can be a string with a fourth number at the end. Add a fourth number `.1` (and then `.2`, `.3` etc..) to your version number while developing, until you are sure that the build is completely ready. Then you can remove the suffix and `ios-CFBundleVersion` will be the same as `version`.
