All you need to have is: NodeJS 10+ Yarn : a NodeJS package manager, like npm Docker to have a Cozy for dev Some basics about developing a single page application in HTML/JS or you just want to learn :) Install the development environment \u00b6 The only tool required to have a Cozy for development is Docker. Install Docker for OSX Install Docker for Windows (We have been told that installing Docker on some familial flavours of Windows may be a bit difficult. It has not been tested yet for this documentation.) Install Docker for GNU/linux: Ubuntu / Fedora / Debian / CentOs On GNU/Linux, according to the documentation : \u00ab The docker daemon binds to a Unix socket instead of a TCP port. By default that Unix socket is owned by the user root and other users can only access it using sudo. If you don\u2019t want to use sudo when you use the docker command, create a Unix group called docker and add users to it. Be warned that the docker group grants privileges equivalent to the root user. You should have a look at Docker\u2019s documentation on security . Every application running inside Cozy is a client-side HTML5 application interacting with your data through the API of the server. To develop an application, you\u2019ll require a running Cozy server. The easiest way is to use the Docker image for developers we provide. Just install it: docker pull cozy/cozy-app-dev Note We update this image on a regular basis with the latest version of the server and our library. Don\u2019t forget to update the image by running docker pull cozy/cozy-app-dev from time to time to keep your Cozy dev up to date. Create your application \u00b6 You can boostrap your application from scratch if you want, but we highly recommand to use our dedicated community tool create-cozy-app to bootstrap very easily a Cozy application for you. This tool will generate an application using React, the framework we internally use in the Cozy Front team. But options are available if you want to use other frameworks. To do so, run directly create-cozy-app without installing it globally by using the yarn create cozy-app command to bootstrap your application: yarn create cozy-app mycozyapp The script will download some dependencies (may take a while) and ask you a few questions, then create an application skeleton inside mycozyapp . Here is a quick demo of what\u2019s happening: That\u2019s it! You can already start developing: cd mycozyapp yarn start This command will run webpack in a watching mode with a server (webpack-dev-server) to serve application assets. a Cozy stack using docker (the image cozy/cozy-app-dev ) to serve your application inside it. The same docker image starts a CouchDB containing your data (be careful, since a data volume is not attached by default, your data will disappear on restart. You should start the docker image manually if you want to persist your data). Your application will be available at http:// .cozy.tools:8080. Password is cozy . In this mode HMR (Hot Module Replacement) is available to help you with the application development. Going Further \u00b6 What is cozy.tools ? \u00b6 You may see in our documentation that we use *.cozy.tools as domain for the local Cozy. Since Cozy uses subdomains to serve the applications, we can\u2019t use directly localhost as it. We have just parameterized this *.cozy.tools domain to always redirect to 127.0.0.1 , your local computer address. With that, no need to configure your environment to set extra local hosts for development anymore. How the application works? \u00b6 The minimal application consist of only two files: an HTML file, index.html , with the markup and the code of your application a manifest describing the application. It\u2019s a JSON file named manifest.webapp with the name of the application, the permissions it requires\u2026 We\u2019ll have a deeper look to it content later. Your application requires some informations to interact with the server API, for example the URL of its entrypoint, and an auth token. This data will be dynamically injected into index.html when it serves the page. So the index.html file has to contain some string that will be replaced by the server. The general syntax of this variables is {{\u2026}} , so don\u2019t use this syntax for other purpose in the page, for example inside comments. You can use the following variables: {{.Domain}} will be substituted by the URL of the API entrypoint {{.Token}} will be replaced by a token that authenticate your application when accessing the API {{.Locale}} : the lang f the instance {{.AppName}} : the name of the application {{.AppNamePrefix}} : the name prefix of the application {{.AppSlug}} : the slug of the application {{.AppEditor}} : the editor of the application {{.IconPath}} will be replaced by HTML code to display the favicon {{.CozyClientJS}} will be replaced with HTML code to inject the Cozy client library (old Cozy client) {{.CozyBar}} will be replaced with HTML code to inject the upper menu bar {{.ThemeCSS}} will be replaced by the theme.css . It is empty by default, but can be overrided by using contexts . {{.Favicon}} will be replaced by the favicon served by the stack. This allows to get this kind of index.html : <!DOCTYPE html> < html lang = \"{{.Locale}}\" > < head > < meta charset = \"utf-8\" > < title > My Awesome App for Cozy </ title > < meta name = \"viewport\" content = \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" > < link rel = \"stylesheet\" src = \"my-app.css\" > {{.ThemeCSS}} {{.CozyClientJS}} {{.CozyBar}} </ head > < body > < div role = \"application\" data-cozy-token = \"{{.Token}}\" data-cozy-stack = \"{{.Domain}}\" > </ div > < script src = \"my-app.js\" ></ script > </ body > </ html > Read the application manifest \u00b6 Each application must have a \u201cmanifest\u201d. It\u2019s a JSON file named manifest.webapp stored at the root of theapplication directory. It describes the application, the type of documents it uses, the permissions it requires\u2026 Here\u2019s a sample manifest: { \"name\" : \"My Awesome application\" , \"name_prefix\" : \"\" , \"slug\" : \"myapp\" , \"permissions\" : { \"apps\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.apps\" }, \"permissions\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.permissions\" }, \"settings\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.settings\" }, \"sample\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.dev.sample\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"GET\" , \"POST\" , \"PUT\" , \"PATCH\" , \"DELETE\" ] }, \"jobs\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.jobs\" } }, \"routes\" : { \"/\" : { \"folder\" : \"/\" , \"index\" : \"index.html\" , \"public\" : false }, \"/public\" : { \"folder\" : \"/public\" , \"index\" : \"index.html\" , \"public\" : true } } } Permissions \u00b6 Applications require permissions to use most of the APIs. Permissions can be described inside the manifest, so theserver can ask the user to grant them during installation. Applications can also request permissions at run time. A permission must at type contain a target, the type of objects the application want to interact with. Can be a document type, or an action on the server. By default, all grant on this object are granted, but we can also request fine grained permissions, for example limiting to read access. We can also limit the scope to a subset of thedocuments. In the manifest, each permission is an object, with a random name and some properties: - type : mandatory the document type or action name - description : a text that will be displayed to the user to explain why the application require this permission - verbs : an array of HTTP verbs. For example, to limit permissions to read access, use [\"GET\"] - selector : a document attribute to limit access to a subset of documents - values : array of allowed values for this attribute. An application can request a token that grant access to a subset of its own permissions. For example if the application has full access to the files, it can obtain a token that give only read access on a file. Thus, the application can make some documents publicly available. The public page of the application will use this token asauthentication token when accessing the API. Samples \u00b6 Application require full access to files: { \"permissions\" : { \"files\" : { \"description\" : \"\u2026\" , \"type\" : \"io.cozy.files\" }, } } Application want to be able to read the contact informations of cozy@cozycloud.cc { \"permissions\" : { \"contact\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.contacts\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"GET\" ], \"selector\" : \"email\" , \"values\" : [ \"cozy@cozycloud.cc\" ] } } } Routing \u00b6 The application must declare all of its URLs (routes) inside the manifest. A route is an object associating an URL toan HTML file. Each route has the following properties: folder : the base folder of the route index : the name of the file inside this folder public : a boolean specifying whether the route is public or private (default). Sample: \"routes\" : { \"/admin\" : { \"folder\" : \"/\" , \"index\" : \"admin.html\" , \"public\" : false }, \"/public\" : { \"folder\" : \"/public\" , \"index\" : \"index.html\" , \"public\" : true }, \"/assets\" : { \"folder\" : \"/assets\" , \"public\" : true } } Behind the magic \u00b6 Some server APIs may not be available right now through the library. If you want to use one of this method, you\u2019llhave to call it manually. We\u2019ll describe here how to access the API without using the Cozy Client library. Connecting to the API requires three things: its URL, injected into the page through the {{.Domain}} variable the application auth token, injected into the page through the {{.Token}} variable. Each request sent to theserver must include this token in the Authorization header the session cookie, created when you connect to your server. This is an HttpOnly cookie , meaning that JavaScriptapplications can\u2019t read it. This prevent a malicious script to stole the cookie. Here\u2019s a sample code that get API informations provided by the server and query the API: < div data-cozy-token = \"{{.Token}}\" data-cozy-domain = \"{{.Domain}}\" /> document . addEventListener ( 'DOMContentLoaded' , () => { \"use strict\" ; const app = document . querySelector ( '[data-cozy-token]' ); fetch ( `// ${ app . dataset . cozyDomain } /apps` , { method : 'GET' , headers : { Authorization : `Bearer ${ app . dataset . cozyToken } ` // Here we use the auth token }, credentials : 'include' // don\u2019t forget to include the session cookie }) . then ( function ( response ) { if ( response . ok ) { response . json (). then (( result ) => { console . log ( result ); }); } else { throw new Error ( 'Network response was not ok.' ); } }) . catch ( function ( error ) { console . log ( 'There has been a problem with your fetch operation: ' + error . message ); }); }); Handle data with cozy-client \u00b6 cozy-client is a simple and declarative way of managing cozy-stack API callsand resulting data. It is a convenient yet powerful way to bind cozy-stack queries to your components. Getting started How to API docs Discover the Cozy Bar \u00b6 The Cozy Bar is a component that display the Cozy menu on the top of yourapplication and allow inter-apps features like content sharing. Your application interacts with this component through cozy-bar.js , a library injected into your pages by theserver when you add {{.CozyBar}} in the header. It exposes an API behind the window.cozy.bar namespace. Before using it, you have to initialize the library: window.cozy.bar.init({appName: \"Mon application\"}) . Style with Cozy UI \u00b6 If you plan to build a webapp to run on Cozy, you\u2019ll probably want to use a simple and elegant solution to build your interfaces without the mess of dealing with complex markup and CSS. Then Cozy UI is here for you! It relies on Stylus as preprocessor. You can add it as a library in your project to use it out-of-the-box.","title":"Create Your Application"},{"location":"/tutorials/app/#prerequisites","text":"Developing an application for Cozy is quite easy.

Each connector is an independent application, managed by the [Cozy Collect] application. To protect your data, each connector runs inside a container in order to sandbox all their interactions with your data. \u26a0\ufe0f For historical reasons, in the Cozy codebase, a cozy connector is named konnector, please follow this convention if modifying an existing application. How does it work? \u00b6 A connector is a NodeJS script. The target node version used to run your connector is the version 8. Like client side apps, connectors communicate with the Cozy Stack using its HTTP API, and get a unique auth token every time they start. They need to register with a manifest, and ask the user for permissions. To facilitate connector development, a npm package, cozy-konnector-libs , provides some shared libraries that are adapted to be used for a connector: cheerio to easily query a HTML page request-promise : request with Promise support request-debug that displays all the requests and responses in the standard output. Toggle debug option in requestFactory options Besides, you\u2019ll probably need some other npm packages to help you run your connector: momentjs or date-fns to manage dates bluebird to get enhanced promises When the connector is started, it also receives some data via environment variables: COZY_CREDENTIALS : an auth token used by cozy-client-js to communicate with the server COZY_URL : the Cozy Stack API entry point COZY_FIELDS : settings coming from [Cozy Collect] and filled by the user (login, password, directory path). These variables are used by the connector and the cozy-client to configure the connection to the Cozy Stack with the right permissions as defined in the connector manifest. They are simulated in standalone mode so that you do not need a real Cozy Stack to develop a connector. [ More about BaseKonnector ] From the server point of view, each connector is a job which is executed periodically via a trigger . [ More about Cozy Stack jobs ] Let\u2019s create our first connector \u00b6 The easiest way to create a new connector is to use cozy-konnector-template : \u2139 There is also a (french) youtube video to create your first connector Run the sample \u00b6 First of all, download or clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/konnectors/cozy-konnector-template cozy-konnector-newservice cd cozy-konnector-newservice rm -rf .git git init yarn install # or npm install note: we use yarn , but if you prefer npm , keep using it, everything should work. The connector is ready to run with sample code. As a demo we will scrape a fictional website: books.toscrape.com , for which you do not need credentials . As indicated in the README.md file, just run: yarn standalone # or npm run standalone The very first run will create a konnector-dev-config.json file that allows you to configure the connector input when executing it with the CLI. This configuration comes from [Cozy Collect] when deployed. { \"COZY_URL\" : \"http://cozy.tools:8080\" , \"fields\" : { // configuration injected to the start function } } The fields property allows you to set credentials for the targeted web service, such as login and password as if they come from Cozy Stack (so from a real Cozy Cloud instance). You can add as many fields as the targeted service needs. The COZY_URL property will be used later. You do not need to change it for now. As explained earlier, the demo website books.toscrape.com does not need any credentials. But for the code to run without error, you need to register a fake login and a fake password: { \"COZY_URL\" : \"http://cozy.tools:8080\" , \"fields\" : { \"login\" : \"zuck.m@rk.fb\" , \"password\" : \"123456\" } } In the template, this configuration file is already added to .gitignore file to be sure your credentials stay private. Now you can run the connector again in standalone mode to see how jpg and related data are downloaded. In this mode, [ cozy-client-js ] is stubbed and all data meant to be saved in a cozy are displayed in the standard output and files are saved in the ./data directory of the connector. This is useful to start developing your connector without handling the state of a real Cozy Stack . Please check CLI section of the documentation for more information. Implement your connector \u00b6 There are four steps for a connector to save data to Cozy Stack : authentication request data parse and format data save data to cozy stack You can see these steps in the src/index.js in the konnectors/template : async function start ( fields ) { // step 1. log ( 'info' , 'Authenticating ...' ) await authenticate ( fields . login , fields . password ) log ( 'info' , 'Successfully logged in' ) // step 2. // The BaseKonnector instance expects a Promise as return of the function log ( 'info' , 'Fetching the list of documents' ) const $ = await request ( ` ${ baseUrl } /index.html` ) // step 3. log ( 'info' , 'Parsing list of documents' ) const documents = await parseDocuments ( $ ) // step 4. // here we use the saveBills function even if what we fetch are not bills, but this is the most // common case in connectors log ( 'info' , 'Saving data to Cozy' ) await saveBills ( documents , fields . folderPath , { // this is a bank identifier which will be used to link bills to bank operations. These // identifiers should be at least a word found in the title of a bank operation related to this // bill. It is not case sensitive. identifiers : [ 'books' ] }) } Authentication \u00b6 Open the src/index.js file, there are comments to guide you through it. The very first step is to be able to authenticate to the remote service, this is done with the line: note: don\u2019t forget to add your additional fields if you have some. await authenticate ( fields . login , fields . password ) There are many obstacles at this level: is there a captcha? is there a 2FA? how is the <form> ? note: if the remote service exposes an API, you should use classical request call. Let\u2019s say the remote service exposes a simple classical form like https://www.trainline.eu/signin: < form id = \"signin-form\" novalidate = \"\" class = \"signin__form\" data-ember-action = \"\" data-ember-action-680 = \"680\" > < input name = \"email\" autocomplete = \"on\" placeholder = \"Email Address\" id = \"ember691\" class = \"ember-text-field textfield ember-view\" data-enpass . usermodified = \"yes\" type = \"email\" > < input name = \"password\" autocomplete = \"on\" placeholder = \"Password\" id = \"ember696\" class = \"ember-text-field textfield ember-view\" data-enpass . usermodified = \"yes\" type = \"password\" > < div class = \"signin__forgot\" > < span data-ember-action = \"\" data-ember-action-697 = \"697\" > < a href = \"/password\" id = \"ember698\" class = \"ember-view\" > Forgot your password? </ a > </ span > </ div > < div class = \"signin__buttons \" > < div class = \"signin__buttons-block\" > < button type = \"submit\" class = \"signin__button\" > Sign In </ button > </ div > </ div > </ form > Find a CSS selector for the form tag: form#signin-form . Find the name of the input tags used to host user\u2019s credentials: email and password . You are ready to complete the signin(options) object called in the authenticate(username, password) function: function authenticate ( username , password ) { return signin ({ url : `https://www.trainline.eu/signin` , formSelector : 'form#signin-form' , formData : { email : username , password }, // \"email\" and \"password\" correspond to the name attribut of the HTML inputs validate : ( statusCode , $ ) => { // write some code to validate the form submission } }) } To implement the validate function, you need to check what is happening on a successful login and on an unsuccessful login. With the https://www.trainline.eu/signin example, fill the form with wrong credentials, open your browser\u2019s devtools (and check the network tab) and submit the form. Here it is clear, on incorrect credentials, the response have a status code 422 : HTTP/2.0 422 No Reason Phrase Do the same with valid credentials. HTTP/2.0 200 OK Then you can write a simple and straight forward validate code: function authenticate ( username , password ) { return signin ({ url : `https://www.trainline.eu/signin` , formSelector : 'form#signin-form' , formData : { email : username , password }, validate : ( statusCode , $ ) => { return statusCode === 200 || log ( 'error' , 'Invalid credentials' ) } }) } However if the target website doesn\u2019t use statusCode correctly you can also use fullResponse.request.uri.href to check if there is a redirection to a page that requires to be logged in : validate : ( statusCode , $ , fullResponse ) => { return fullResponse . request . uri . href == 'https://example.com/account' || log ( 'error' , 'Invalid credentials' ) } It is also possible to use Cheerio to check if an HTML element is present in the web page or not : validate : ( statusCode , $ ) => { return $ ( 'a[href=\"https://example.com/logout\"]' ). length == 1 || log ( 'error' , $ ( '.error' ). text ()) } Request data \u00b6 Once the connector is able to be authenticated by the online service, the next step is to fetch data. The most common case is that the invoices we want to fetch are listed in a HTML page. So to request data, we fetch the target webpage that contains invoices list. But sometimes, the webpage is a JavaScript page that uses a JSON API URL. JSON is easier to parse than full HTML webpages. For the purpose of this guide, let\u2019s consider we are in the case of a full HTML webpage, like the service given as an example in the template: http://books.toscrape.com This is the easiest part, just fetch the webpage: const $ = await request ( 'http://books.toscrape.com/index.html' ) The $ variable is set to a cheerio object with useful API to crawl the webpage . \u2139 You can name this variable as you want and create as many as you want Cheerio variables such as : $doc or $page . That object will be very useful for the next step. Parse the document \u00b6 We want to get every <article /> of the page in a JavaScript Array: const articles = []. map . call ( $ ( 'article' , node => node )) For every book, we want to catch the title attribute of this tag article h3 a . This is a CSS Selector that cheerio understands to select some part of the tree. In order to crawl a list of items to create an Array of JSON object, we can create our own function or use the function scrape from the connector libs : const docs = scrape ( $ , { title : { sel : 'h3 a' , attr : 'title' }, amount : { sel : '.price_color' , parse : normalizePrice }, url : { sel : 'h3 a' , attr : 'href' , parse : url => ` ${ baseUrl } / ${ url } ` }, fileurl : { sel : 'img' , attr : 'src' , parse : src => ` ${ baseUrl } / ${ src } ` }, filename : { sel : 'h3 a' , attr : 'title' , parse : title => ` ${ title } .jpg` } }, 'article' ) Keep in mind that there are many useful CSS Pseudo-classes and Combinators that you can use in your CSS selectors to help you select HTML elements. This code will loop on <article /> and for each item will create a JSON object with the selector sel and the value of attribute attr if specified, otherwise it takes the value of the child node, this value can be edited with the parse function. Here is a sample for the following markup from http://books.toscrape.com: < article class = \"product_pod\" > < div class = \"image_container\" > < a href = \"catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html\" > < img src = \"media/cache/2c/da/2cdad67c44b002e7ead0cc35693c0e8b.jpg\" alt = \"A Light in the Attic\" class = \"thumbnail\" > </ a > </ div > < p class = \"star-rating Three\" > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > </ p > < h3 > < a href = \"catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html\" title = \"A Light in the Attic\" > A Light in the ... </ a > </ h3 > < div class = \"product_price\" > < p class = \"price_color\" > \u00a351.77 </ p > < p class = \"instock availability\" > < i class = \"icon-ok\" ></ i > In stock </ p > < form > < button type = \"submit\" class = \"btn btn-primary btn-block\" data-loading-text = \"Adding...\" > Add to basket </ button > </ form > </ div > </ article > And we will get the following JSON object: { \"title\" : \"A Light in the Attic\" , \"amount\" : 51.77 , \"url\" : \"http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html\" , \"fileurl\" : \"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/2c/da/2cdad67c44b002e7ead0cc35693c0e8b.jpg\" , \"filename\" : \"A Light in the Attic.jpg\" } fileurl is used to tell Cozy where to find the file (here an image) to retreive. Then you can save it to Cozy Stack (see section below). There are many document types (Doctypes) you can store in your Cozy, such as : - Bills - Contacts - Bank - and so on\u2026 The code sample includes some other function to manipulate the result object, but we have the idea. Once we build a correct object, we can save it to Cozy Stack. Save data to Cozy Stack \u00b6 In the example we use some built-in function to save a bill to the Cozy Stack. But there is a bunch of functions available depending on what you want: addData hydrateAndFilter saveBills to save invoices files (this function use saveFiles ) that can be linked to your bank transactions. saveFiles to upload files to Cozy Drive. and so on\u2026 For example, to save bills to Cozy you have to start by recovering all required fields for a data type io.cozy.bills using the scrape function, and then you can use the function saveBills to save your docs to Cozy Stack as shown below: await saveBills ( documents , fields , { idenditifiers : [ 'vendor' ], // name of the target website contentType : 'application/pdf' }) documents is the list of bills returned by the function parseDocuments after the page scraping . We can find more information in the libs repository . Now that we pass on every steps, it is time to test the connector with yarn standalone . We will see next how to connect it effectively to a Cozy Stack. Going further \u00b6 Connector structure \u00b6 Basically, a connector is just a function passed to the BaseKonnector constructor, and which eventually returns a promise: To create the connector, just create a new instance of BaseKonnector with a function as argument: const { BaseKonnector } = require ( 'cozy-konnector-libs' ) module . exports = new BaseKonnector ( fields => { // use fields to get user credentials and choices console . log ( fields , 'fields' ) }) Typical workflow \u00b6 Everytime the connector is run, it will call the function and wait for the resolution of the returned promise. This function can then: log into the target website, fetch data, and save them as an array of objects with specific attributes expected by the save function ( saveFiles , addData , hydrateAndFilter , saveBills ). A basic connector workflow involves: authenticate on the website or API. Might be tricky, but that\u2019s the fun :-) getting data from the online service. You can get the data by calling an API or scraping the webpage. Check if the webpage itself is not using an API to retrieve data, might speed up our job. Mobile phones applications usually connects to an API that might be a reliable source of data. A quick exemple of a scraper here . filtering data to remove the ones already present inside the database using hydrateAndFilter save the filtered data into the database ( addData ) save the related files using ( saveFiles ) Error handling \u00b6 If your connector hits an issue fetching or saving the data, it can return an error code by throwing it as an error. The error codes are defined inside the [Cozy Collect] application and will display an explicit error to the user: LOGIN_FAILED : the connector could not login NOT_EXISTING_DIRECTORY : the folder specified as folder_to_save does not exist (checked automatically by the BaseKonnector) UNKNOWN_ERROR : there was an unexpected error, please take a look at the logs to know what happened VENDOR_DOWN : the target web site is down now USER_ACTION_NEEDED : The user needs to login to the service to do manual actions (could be Terms Of Service to validate) You can get the list of error codes in require('cozy-konnector-libs').errors ( source ) const { BaseKonnector , errors } = require ( 'cozy-konnector-libs' ) module . exports = new BaseKonnector ( fields => { // Here, the following message will be displayed in cozy-collect : \"Bad credentials. Check the konnector fields and run the connection again.\" throw new Error ( errors . LOGIN_FAILED ) }) cozy-konnector-libs \u00b6 The Cozy Konnector Libs provide several useful methods for common tasks: BaseKonnector : creates the connector and fetches from the stack the connector\u2019s parameters (COZY_FIELDS\u2026) cozyClient gives an instance of cozy-client-js already initialized according to COZY_URL , and COZY_CREDENTIALS . Your code can immediately interact with the server thanks to this client. requestFactory a function which returns an instance of request-promise initialized with defaults often used in connector development. log allows to log messages with different levels hydrateAndFilter to filter data addData to store the retrieved data into the cozy linkBankOperations to link a bill to a bank operation saveBills which uses hydrateAndFilter, addData, saveFiles and linkBankOperations and which is specific to bills updateOrCreate create or update documents inside database htmlToPDF to convert HTML code to PDF content to insert into a PDF file created with the createCozyPDFDocument function createCozyPDFDocument to create a new PDF file to pass to htmlToPDF Linking your connector to a cozy : dev mode \u00b6 After several yarn standalone , your connector is able to automaticaly gather data from the targeted web service. It\u2019s time now to put this data in a real cozy. Here comes the dev mode . For that your connector needs more setup : a manifest.konnector file a COZY_URL section in konnector-dev-config.json The manifest \u00b6 Each connector is described by a manifest. This is a JSON file named manifest.konnector at the root of your code folder. It should include the following minimal information: { \"name\" : \"konnector name\" , \"type\" : \"node\" , \"slug\" : \"konnectorslug\" , \"description\" : \"description\" , \"source\" : \"git://github.com/cozy/cozy-konnector-thename.git\" , \"permissions\" : { \"accounts\" : { \"description\" : \"Required to get the account's data\" , \"type\" : \"io.cozy.accounts\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"GET\" ] } } } cozy-konnector-template already has a manifest which you can customize. You may add some permissions for your own doctype. Here is the detailed list of fields for a connector manifest file. You can also get more information on permissions in the official cozy-stack documentation konnector-dev-config.json \u00b6 If you want to put data from your connector to a real cozy, your must define where to find this cozy, and this must be a cozy for which you have the credentials. Here comes the COZY_URL in konnector-dev-config.json which defines just that. Run the dev mode \u00b6 Then you just have to run: yarn dev For the first run, the CLI will open a tab in your browser asking you to grant permissions to the connector. The connector will then save data directly into your cozy. This will validate that your manifest has the needed permissions on the data you want to save. This is the dev mode. Integration in the store for all the users \u00b6 To run a connector, we do not want the cozy to install all dependencies of the connector each time it installs it. To avoid this, the connectors need to be compiled into one file in a dedicated branch of the repository and the repository needs to be a public git repository. The package.json file from cozy-konnector-template gives you the commands to do this : yarn build and yarn deploy but the last one needs to be configured in package.json Once your public git repository is configured, you only have to declare it. Cozy will soon have a store for connectors and you will be able to publish connectors yourself. But at the moment, you need to declare your new connector on the cozy forum . The Cozy team will review your code and add your connector to the [Cozy Collect] application. To make the connector available more quickly for all cozys, you can follow this few steps of packaging: Icon \u00b6 You need to push an icon in assets/ . Please respect this rules : Square icon, possibly a png or svg Try the Apple app store icon if needed Package.json \u00b6 Edit the name to be cozy-konnector-<slug> Edit the repository URL Edit the command deploy with the correct repository URL Manifest.konnector \u00b6 Edit the name with a nice name (Capitals and spaces allowed here) Edit icon as needed Edit slug (no capitals and no spaces here) Edit source with the correct repository URL Add a correct vendor link Choose one or more categories (used to sort connectors in Cozy Store) in this list : banking, shopping, insurance, isp, telecom, energy, public_service, other . If needed, change the input type the target website use to login the user: text , email or phone for instance, this will enforce pre-checking Edit for both locales en and fr the short description and long description FAQ \u00b6 When I run my connector, a ghost node process eats all my memory \u00b6 Cozy-konnector-libs uses cheerio which is great but causes some problems when you try to console.log a cheerio object. In standalone or dev mode, the BaseKonnector tries to catch errors and display a maximum of details about them. But when the error contains a cheerio object, the problem happens. If you get this problem, catch the error yourself and only display the message : . catch ( err ) { console . log ( err . message ) // good console . log ( err ) // bad } How do I scrap a website \u00b6 Use the request function from cozy-konnector-libs with the proper options. Here\u2019s a sample code that will fetch the login page to get the value of the anti-CSRF token, submit the login form, browse to the bills page and fetch a bill: const { BaseKonnector , requestFactory } = require ( 'cozy-konnector-libs' ) const rq = requestFactory ({ jar : true , // handle the cookies like a browser json : false , // do not try to parse the result as a json document cheerio : true // automatically parse the result with [cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio) }) const moment = require ( 'moment' ) module . exports = new BaseKonnector ( function fetch ( fields ) { return rq ( \"https://login.remote.web\" ) . then ( $ => { // the result is automatically wrapped with cheerio and you can use it like jQuery const form = { form : { login : fields . login , password : fields . password , csrf_token : $ ( '[name=\"csrf_token\"]' ). val (), } } return rq ({ method : 'POST' , form }) }) . then ( $ => rq ( \"https://admin.remote.web/bills\" )) . then ( $ => { return [{ date : moment ( $ ( \"#bill_date\" )), value : $ ( \"#bill_value\" )}] }) . then ( entries => addData ( entries , 'io.cozy.bills' )) }) What does the yarn deploy command do ? \u00b6 This will deploy a compiled version of your connector in a dedicated branch of your git repository using git-directory-deploy . This deployed version can then be referenced to cozy-app-publish to deploy your connector to the registry. I want to pass secret variables to my connector without hardcoding it in the source code \u00b6 COZY_PARAMETERS environment variable will help you. In standalone mode or dev mode, you can init it in konnector-dev-config.json : \"COZY_PARAMETERS\" : { \"secret\" : { \"mySecretKey\" : \"s3cr3tk3y\" } } In your connector, you will get these secrets as a second parameter in your main function. module . exports = new BaseKonnector ( start ) async function start ( fields , cozyParameters ) { log ( 'info' , cozyParameters . secret . mySecretKey ) } // -> \"s3cr3tk3y\" If you want to know how this works in a real cozy, you can find more information on Stack documentation","title":"Develop a Connector"},{"location":"/tutorials/konnector/#introduction","text":"A connector (also known as konnector ) is a script that imports data from another web service and put those data into your cozy.

The target node version used to run your connector is the version 8. Like client side apps, connectors communicate with the Cozy Stack using its HTTP API, and get a unique auth token every time they start. They need to register with a manifest, and ask the user for permissions. To facilitate connector development, a npm package, cozy-konnector-libs , provides some shared libraries that are adapted to be used for a connector: cheerio to easily query a HTML page request-promise : request with Promise support request-debug that displays all the requests and responses in the standard output. Toggle debug option in requestFactory options Besides, you\u2019ll probably need some other npm packages to help you run your connector: momentjs or date-fns to manage dates bluebird to get enhanced promises When the connector is started, it also receives some data via environment variables: COZY_CREDENTIALS : an auth token used by cozy-client-js to communicate with the server COZY_URL : the Cozy Stack API entry point COZY_FIELDS : settings coming from [Cozy Collect] and filled by the user (login, password, directory path). These variables are used by the connector and the cozy-client to configure the connection to the Cozy Stack with the right permissions as defined in the connector manifest.

The connector is ready to run with sample code. As a demo we will scrape a fictional website: books.toscrape.com , for which you do not need credentials . As indicated in the README.md file, just run: yarn standalone # or npm run standalone The very first run will create a konnector-dev-config.json file that allows you to configure the connector input when executing it with the CLI. This configuration comes from [Cozy Collect] when deployed. { \"COZY_URL\" : \"http://cozy.tools:8080\" , \"fields\" : { // configuration injected to the start function } } The fields property allows you to set credentials for the targeted web service, such as login and password as if they come from Cozy Stack (so from a real Cozy Cloud instance). You can add as many fields as the targeted service needs. The COZY_URL property will be used later. You do not need to change it for now. As explained earlier, the demo website books.toscrape.com does not need any credentials. But for the code to run without error, you need to register a fake login and a fake password: { \"COZY_URL\" : \"http://cozy.tools:8080\" , \"fields\" : { \"login\" : \"zuck.m@rk.fb\" , \"password\" : \"123456\" } } In the template, this configuration file is already added to .gitignore file to be sure your credentials stay private. Now you can run the connector again in standalone mode to see how jpg and related data are downloaded. In this mode, [ cozy-client-js ] is stubbed and all data meant to be saved in a cozy are displayed in the standard output and files are saved in the ./data directory of the connector.

Here is a sample for the following markup from http://books.toscrape.com: < article class = \"product_pod\" > < div class = \"image_container\" > < a href = \"catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html\" > < img src = \"media/cache/2c/da/2cdad67c44b002e7ead0cc35693c0e8b.jpg\" alt = \"A Light in the Attic\" class = \"thumbnail\" > </ a > </ div > < p class = \"star-rating Three\" > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > </ p > < h3 > < a href = \"catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html\" title = \"A Light in the Attic\" > A Light in the ... </ a > </ h3 > < div class = \"product_price\" > < p class = \"price_color\" > \u00a351.77 </ p > < p class = \"instock availability\" > < i class = \"icon-ok\" ></ i > In stock </ p > < form > < button type = \"submit\" class = \"btn btn-primary btn-block\" data-loading-text = \"Adding...\" > Add to basket </ button > </ form > </ div > </ article > And we will get the following JSON object: { \"title\" : \"A Light in the Attic\" , \"amount\" : 51.77 , \"url\" : \"http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html\" , \"fileurl\" : \"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/2c/da/2cdad67c44b002e7ead0cc35693c0e8b.jpg\" , \"filename\" : \"A Light in the Attic.jpg\" } fileurl is used to tell Cozy where to find the file (here an image) to retreive.

This is what make the application available on the server: $ docker run --rm -it \\ -p 8080 :8080 \\ -p 8025 :8025 \\ --name cozydev \\ -v \"~/cozy/myapp\" :/data/cozy-app \\ cozy/cozy-app-dev Commands explaination --rm will delete the server when you stop it. This prevent Docker from keeping a lot of unused stopped images -it allow to attach an interactive terminal, so you\u2019ll be able to use the command line inside the server -p 8080:8080 : the server listens on port 8080 on the virtual machine. We forward this port to the same port on your local machine. To use another local port, for example 9090, use -p 9090:8080 -p 8025:8025 : Cozy requires a mail server. In the development image, we don\u2019t use a real email server, but a software that can display the sent messages. Just point your browser to http://cozy.tools:8025/ to display the messages sent by the server --name cozydev name the running virtual machine cozydev , so you can easily refer to it from other Docker commands. For example, if you want to connect to a shell inside the server, you can use docker exec cozydev -it /bin/bash -v $(pwd):/data/cozy-app this mount the current folder, where your application leaves, inside the server. This is what make the application available on the server With data persistence \u00b6 If you want to persist data, you have to mount two folders from the virtual server to local folders: /usr/local/couchdb/data (database) and /data/cozy-storage (the virtual filesystem). This can be achieved by adding to the two command lines with -v which will store the server\u2019s data into ~/cozy/data/ . $ docker run --rm -it \\ -p 8080 :8080 \\ -p 8025 :8025 \\ --name cozydev \\ -v \"~/cozy/myapp\" :/data/cozy-app \\ -v \"~/cozy/data/db\" :/usr/local/couchdb/data \\ -v \"~/cozy/data/storage\" :/data/cozy-storage \\ cozy/cozy-app-dev Run with a custom stack config file \u00b6 The cozy-stack config file can be useful to change the log level for example. You have to load it inside /etc/cozy/cozy.yaml like this: $ docker run --rm -it \\ -p 8080 :8080 \\ -p 8025 :8025 \\ --name cozydev \\ -v \"~/cozy/myapp\" :/data/cozy-app \\ -v \"~/cozy/cozy.yaml\" :/etc/cozy/cozy.yaml \\ cozy/cozy-app-dev You can learn more about the cozy-stack config file in its dedicated documentation Run two applications watched locally \u00b6 You can install more than one application into the development server, for example to test communication between applications. In order to achieve this, you have to mount the folder where your application leaves into subfolders of /data/cozy-apps like this: $ docker run --rm -it \\ -p 8080 :8080 \\ -p 8025 :8025 \\ --name cozydev \\ -v \"~/cozy/appone\" :/data/cozy-app/appone \\ -v \"~/cozy/apptwo\" :/data/cozy-app/apptwo \\ cozy/cozy-app-dev You\u2019ll access the applications by connecting to http://appone.cozy.tools:8080/ and http://apptwo.cozy.tools:8080 . Mailhog to catch e-mails and CouchDB access \u00b6 A MailHog is running inside docker to catch emails. You can view the emails sent by the stack in a web interface on http://cozy.tools:8025/ You can also expose the couchdb port (listening in the container on 5984) in order to access its admin page.

Therefore we will use the classical stack: a JavaScript web application and cordova At the end of this documentation , you will find how-tos to help you with cordova configuration , webpack builds and cordova deployments for Android and iOS . To create your first Cozy application , just follow the guide. As you can read there, Cozy applications are served by the Cozy server, this is the way that Cozy applications retrieve a token to query data. In the case of a mobile application, you need to retrieve a token differently. Hopefully we provide everything you need to do it easily. You\u2019ll need two libraries: cozy-client ( source ) cozy-bar ( source ) In the case of Cozy web applications served by the Cozy server, these two libraries are injected in the html file with variables {{.CozyClientJS}} and {{.CozyBar}} . Setup index.html \u00b6 First thing first, add JavaScript libraries files into your index.html : <!DOCTYPE html> < html lang = \"en\" > < head > < meta charset = \"utf-8\" > < title > mobile Cozy application with Cordova </ title > < script src = \"cozy-client.js\" ></ script > < script src = \"cozy-bar.js\" ></ script > </ head > < body > <!-- page content --> </ body > </ html > Connect to Cozy server \u00b6 When an user will start your mobile Cozy application, she/he will need to point to her/his server url to ask for permissions for her/his device. This is done by our library cozy-client , you just need to add a HTML form: < form id = \"form\" > < label > What is your cozy server url? < input name = \"url\" id = \"url\" type = \"text\" /> </ label > < button type = \"submit\" > Submit </ button > </ form > const urlInput = document . getElementById ( \"url\" ); const form = document . getElementById ( \"form\" ); form . addEventListener ( \"submit\" , registerClient ); function registerClient ( event ) { event . preventDefault (); const url = urlInput . value ; const { client , token } = await cozyClient . register ( url ); // do whatever you need with client and token like persist } JS Bin on jsbin.com When cozyClient.register(url) is called, the cordova inapp browser plugin is used to display a password request and a permission acceptation page to let the end-user to register her/his device. That\u2019s all! Then you can use the cozy-client library as you would within a classic Cozy application . Initialize the Cozy bar \u00b6 The Cozy bar needs some information to be initialized and its initialization must be done in your front-end code: cozy . bar . init ({ appName : \"App Name\" , appEditor : \"Editor Name\" , iconPath : require ( \"./assets/app-icon.svg\" ), lang : \"en-US\" , replaceTitleOnMobile : true }) Use Cordova \u00b6 Install and setup cordova \u00b6 Cordova is a tool to build Android and iOS applications from a web app. It works with a CLI that needs node . Look at the cordova documentation to install everything needed . Once cordova is installed, just run cordova create cozy-app com.example.cozyapp CozyApp and you get the following structure: ./ \u251c\u2500\u2500 config.xml \u251c\u2500\u2500 hooks \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 README.md \u251c\u2500\u2500 platforms \u251c\u2500\u2500 plugins \u2514\u2500\u2500 www \u251c\u2500\u2500 css \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 index.css \u251c\u2500\u2500 img \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 logo.png \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.html \u2514\u2500\u2500 js \u2514\u2500\u2500 index.js 7 directories, 6 files Note: everything you put in www/ will be served as your application content. Configure your build tool \u00b6 If you use a build tool to transpile your JavaScript code, you need to configure your tool to output the build into www/ . webpack configuration \u00b6 As Webpack is the most used build tool we will show you how to configure it with cordova: Create a webpack.config.js on the root folder of your project with: const path = require ( 'path' ); module . exports = { entry : './src/app.js' , output : { filename : 'bundle.js' , path . resolve ( __dirname , 'www' ) } } And add the output bundle in the www/index.html file: < html > < head > ... </ head > < body > ... < script src = \"bundle.js\" ></ script > </ body > </ html > See the official webpack documentation for more details.

For that, we need to start our emulator with the following command : ./emulator -writable-system -avd Pixel_API_27 The emulator binary is located at /home/user/Android/Sdk/emulator/ on Linux systems by default.

The whole platform is designed around 3 key values : Simple , Versatile , Yours . These values have a lot of meaning for Cozy in all aspects. From an architectural point of view, they are declined like this: simple and easy to understand and deploy. Cozy doesn\u2019t require to setup and manage a lot of micro-services; versatile : your server is comfortable anywhere. You can host a single instance on a small Raspberry \u03c0 at home, or a cluster of thousands instances on dedicated servers inside a datacenter; yours : the users are the owners of their data, they keep the control. They can migrate their data from one server to another, and are not dependant from a single hosting provider. As we say: \u201cyou will stay because you can leave\u201d; Architecture overview \u00b6 Several layers can be distinguished. From inside to outside: the core is a database that store all user data; the database is accessible through a layer that control accesses and expose a REST API; Web applications and other clients offer nice user interfaces to interact with the data. The server (Cozy-stack - documentation ) \u00b6 The server consist of a single process. We call it the Cozy stack . The server is in charge of serving the Web applications users have installed from the application store. It provides its services through a REST API that allows to: create, update, delete documents inside the database; authenticate users and client applications; send emails; launch jobs on the server. Connectors that import data from remote websites are some sort of jobs. Jobs can be one time tasks (sending a message) or periodic tasks. Some jobs, like the connectors, that require executing third party code on the server side, are sandboxed (we use nsjail for now). \u2026 The server also allow to access the database replication API, allowing to sync documents between the server and local databases, for example in mobile clients. Two authentication methods are available: Web applications running on the server get a session token when the user log in; OAuth2 for other applications. The database \u00b6 CouchDB is a document database. Everything, from user data to server settings, is stored inside typed documents, identified by an unique id. Two request methods are allowed: map-reduce or Mango , a specific query language. Every document has a doctype , and we keep an index of the definition of every doctype. Binary data are stored outside the database. Depending on the server configuration, they may be stored on a file system or a dedicated object storage like swift . The datasystem layer inside the Cozy stack is in charge of controlling access rights on documents and binaries. It allows fine gained access control, on a whole doctype or on a set of documents. The applications \u00b6 There are two kind of applications: web applications : Single Page Applications (SPA) written in HTML and JavaScript that run inside the user\u2019s browser. They interact with the server through its API. This API allows to manipulate data and files and to perform miscellaneous tasks, like send emails connectors : Small application written in JavaScript, running on the server, that import your data from remote sources. The server provides services to applications: real time notifications of events; methods allowing applications to communicate and share data; interapps : applications can expose \u201ccapabilities\u201d that other apps can call. For instance an app can expose the capability to pick a photo or to create a contact. methods allowing sharing of documents between servers. This is a peer-to-peer protocol so that even users hosted on different infrastructure can share their data which are synchronized (the cozy stack propagates modifications between users servers). Application store \u00b6 An application registry lists every available applications, and their characteristics. Each application can: create its own doctypes; request permission to access documents; offer services to other applications; register publics routes; create jobs that will be run on server side. Application isolation \u00b6 Each application uses its own sub-domain, so it gets sandboxed inside the browser: other application are not able to steal its access token or access its data. We use Content Security Policy to control what the application is allowed to do. For example, Web applications running inside Cozy are not allowed to send requests to other websites. This allows a strict control over applications, preventing them to leak your data. Further reading \u00b6 Coding tutorials : Create a client application Develop a connector .

Requirements \u00b6 Node.js version 8 or higher; Install \u00b6 yarn add --dev cozy-app-publish Registry documentation \u00b6 You can find more information about the registry and how to prepare an application to be published in the official registry documentation . Usage via Travis CI (recommended) \u00b6 First of all, don\u2019t forget to build the application: # build the application (in the ./build folder here) yarn build Then, just publish it using the Travis CI workflow: # publish it, REGISTRY_TOKEN should be # encrypted and provided via Travis CI environment # BUILD_COMMIT is your last build commit hash (git rev-parse build) yarn cozy-app-publish \\ --token $REGISTRY_TOKEN \\ --build-commit $BUILD_COMMIT Manual usage (not recommended) \u00b6 First of all, don\u2019t forget to build the application: # build the application (in the ./build folder here) yarn build Then, just publish it using: yarn cozy-app-publish \\ --token $REGISTRY_TOKEN \\ --build-url https://github.com/cozy/cozy-collect/archive/042cef26d9d33ea604fe4364eaab569980b500c9.tar.gz \\ --manual-version 1.0.2-dev.042cef26d9d33ea604fe4364eaab569980b500c9 Options \u00b6 --token <editor-token> (required) \u00b6 The registry editor token. This token must match the editor name and is provided by Cozy Cloud (with the name) in order to use the registry. --build-dir <relative-path> \u00b6 The path to the build folder, relative to the current directory. Since the \u2018standard\u2019 Cozy application builds in the build/ folder, build is the default value. This folder is mainly used to read the application manifest during publishing. --build-url <url> \u00b6 For now, the registry a build archive (.tar.gz file) from an external link to be used in the cozy-stack. In the travis script, this url is computed using the Github trick to get archives from a commit url (but it\u2019s overwritten if provided by this option). For the manual script, we have to provide it. --build-commit <commit-hash> \u00b6 Using the travis mode, the archive tarball URL is computed using github and the build commit hash. If you are not on your build branch to publish, you can specify the correct build commit hash using this parameter. --manual-version <version> (required for manual usage only) \u00b6 In the manual mode, we don\u2019t have a way to compute the version like in the Travis mode for example. So we have to provide it using this option. --prepublish <script_path> \u00b6 Specify custom prepublish hook to manage how the app archive is generated and uploaded. The script must export a asynchronous function which has the following signature: module . exports = async ({ appBuildUrl , appSlug , appType , appVersion , buildCommit , registryUrl , registryEditor , registryToken , spaceName }) => { // ... } This function must return an object containing the same options given as parameter, which can have been updated. For example, you may specifiy a new appBuildUrl in the hook. Here\u2019s a description of the different options: Options Description appBuildUrl The url where the build can be retrieved. For example, http://github.com/cozy/cozy-foo/archives/cozy-foo.tar.gz appSlug The slug of the application, as defined in the manifest. Should not be mutated appType webapp or konnector appVersion App version, as defined in the manifest. Should not be mutated. buildCommit sha of the commit, should not be mutated. registryUrl URL of the Cozy registry, should not be mutated. registryEditor Editor as it appears in the Cozy registry. registryToken Registry Token. See registry documentation . Should not be mutated. spaceName Space name in the Cozy registry. --postpublish <script_path> \u00b6 Works exactly like the prepublish option, but will be executed after the publication. Multiple hooks and built-in hooks \u00b6 You can specify more than one hook by separating them with a , : cozy-app-publish --prepublish <hook_name>,<other_hook_name> Some hooks are shipped with cozy-app-publish and can be used by specifying their name: cozy-app-publish --prepublish <builtin_hook_name> Downcloud prepublish hook \u00b6 cozy-app-publish --prepublish downcloud This hook allows to upload the app to our downcloud server and sets the appBuildUrl accordingly. In order to upload files to our downcloud server, you will need to generate a new pair of RSA keys, add the private key to your ssh-agent and make sure the corresponding public key is present on the downcloud server. Here\u2019s how to do it: Generate a new key pair with ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f id_rsa_downcloud_myapp -C downcloud_myapp_deploy . Communicate the public key to someone who can deposit it on the downcloud server. If you\u2019re running things locally, you\u2019ll want to run ssh-add id_rsa_downcloud_myapp to add it to your ssh-agent. If you\u2019re planing to run this cozy-app-publish on Travis, you\u2019ll want to encrypt that file first . Run travis encrypt-file id_rsa_downcloud_myapp and copy the output. To add the key to Travis\u2019s ssh-agent, add the following lines in the before_install section of your .travis.yml , but don\u2019t forget to paste the output of travis encrypt-file where it\u2019s needed. - if [ \"$TRAVIS_SECURE_ENV_VARS\" != \"false\" ]; then PASTE_TRAVIS_ENCRYPT_OUTPUT_HERE; fi - if [ \"$TRAVIS_SECURE_ENV_VARS\" != \"false\" ]; then eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"; fi - if [ \"$TRAVIS_SECURE_ENV_VARS\" != \"false\" ]; then chmod 600 id_rsa_downcloud_myapp; fi - if [ \"$TRAVIS_SECURE_ENV_VARS\" != \"false\" ]; then ssh-add id_rsa_downcloud_myapp; fi We recommend changing the path used for the private key. You can change the -out argument of the command output by travis encrypt-file and the corresponding path\u2019s in the commands above. /tmp/id_rsa_downcloud_myapp is a good place to store this key. Finally, secure the private key . If you\u2019re using Travis, the key is now stored by Travis so you should delete your local copy. If you\u2019re running things on your machine, make sure the private key doesn\u2019t end up in version control. Rundeck postpublish hook \u00b6 cozy-app-publish --postpublish rundeck Deploys the app on rundeck. This hook requires several variables to be set as environment variables: RUNDECK_TOKEN : the token to use to interact with the Rundeck API. To obtain such a token, ask someone that has admin privileges on the rundeck server. TARGETS_DEV : a comma-separated list of instances to deploy the app on, on the dev channel. TARGETS_BETA : a comma-separated list of instances to deploy the app on, on the beta channel. TARGETS_STABLE : a comma-separated list of instances to deploy the app on, on the stable channel. Mattermost postpublish hook \u00b6 cozy-app-publish --postpublish mattermost Sends a message to a mattermost channel to notify of the app\u2019s deployment. Requires the following options: MATTERMOST_HOOK_URL : You will need to set up a new Incoming Hook . MATTERMOST_CHANNEL : The name of the channel messages will be posted to. --registry-url <url> \u00b6 The url of the registry, by default it will be https://staging-apps-registry.cozycloud.cc. --space <space-name> \u00b6 Use this options to provide a specific space name of the registry to publish the application in. By default it will be published in the default space. --verbose \u00b6 To print more logs when using tool (useful for debug). Recommended workflow \u00b6 Day to day \u00b6 Development is done on feature branches that are merged into master , once they are complete. Every time someone commits on master , a new archive is created and uploaded on Downcloud and it is then deployed on a test instance with Rundeck. Release workflow \u00b6 A new branch is created from the current state of master . Let\u2019s say we want to deploy version 1.0.0 of the app. The only type of commits allowed on this release branch are bug fixes. Every time one or more bugs are fixed and the version is considered for release, the latest commit is tagged with a prerelease version number, eg. 1.0.0-beta.1 , 1.0.0-beta.2 , etc\u2026 Each of these prereleases is automatically uploaded on downcloud and deployed on instances that are on the beta channel. Once the branch is deemed ready for release, the last commit is tagged with the final version \u2014 1.0.0 in our example. It is then, again, uploaded on downcloud, published on the registry and deployed on specific instances as needed. The release branch is merged back into master so that all the bugfixes aren\u2019t lost.","title":"CLI & Workflow"},{"location":"/cozy-app-publish/README/#cozy-app-publish","text":"","title":"Cozy App Publish"},{"location":"/cozy-app-publish/README/#whats-cozy-app-publish","text":"cozy-app-publish is a command line tool that publish a Cozy application to the Cozy registry according to some options.","title":"What's cozy-app-publish?"},{"location":"/cozy-app-publish/README/#requirements","text":"Node.js version 8 or higher;","title":"Requirements"},{"location":"/cozy-app-publish/README/#install","text":"yarn add --dev cozy-app-publish","title":"Install"},{"location":"/cozy-app-publish/README/#registry-documentation","text":"You can find more information about the registry and how to prepare an application to be published in the official registry documentation .","title":"Registry documentation"},{"location":"/cozy-app-publish/README/#usage-via-travis-ci-recommended","text":"First of all, don\u2019t forget to build the application: # build the application (in the ./build folder here) yarn build Then, just publish it using the Travis CI workflow: # publish it, REGISTRY_TOKEN should be # encrypted and provided via Travis CI environment # BUILD_COMMIT is your last build commit hash (git rev-parse build) yarn cozy-app-publish \\ --token $REGISTRY_TOKEN \\ --build-commit $BUILD_COMMIT","title":"Usage via Travis CI (recommended)"},{"location":"/cozy-app-publish/README/#manual-usage-not-recommended","text":"First of all, don\u2019t forget to build the application: # build the application (in the ./build folder here) yarn build Then, just publish it using: yarn cozy-app-publish \\ --token $REGISTRY_TOKEN \\ --build-url https://github.com/cozy/cozy-collect/archive/042cef26d9d33ea604fe4364eaab569980b500c9.tar.gz \\ --manual-version 1.0.2-dev.042cef26d9d33ea604fe4364eaab569980b500c9","title":"Manual usage (not recommended)"},{"location":"/cozy-app-publish/README/#options","text":"","title":"Options"},{"location":"/cozy-app-publish/README/#-token-lteditor-tokengt-required","text":"The registry editor token.

To work properly, it requires: - Couchdb >= 2.0 - Openstack Object Storage (Swift) How to develop with a cozy-apps-registry working in local environment \u00b6 Before starting, you will need to have a couchdb running already. That can be the one used by the local cozy-stack if you have one. For this tutorial, couchdb will be running on the default port 5984. You also must have an OpenStack Object Storage (Swift) up and running. You can follow install instructions on the official website 1) Install and configure the local cozy-apps-registry \u00b6 Since this is a golang project, you can install it using go with the followed command: go get -u github.com/cozy/cozy-apps-registry cd $GOPATH /src/github.com/cozy/cozy-apps-registry/ Then you will need a session secret key to run the registry (this key will be store in the sessionsecret.key file of your working directory) using a password: cozy-apps-registry gen-session-secret --passphrase sessionsecret.key This password is important, you will need it to run the cozy-apps-registry again later. If you lose it, you will have to start again these steps. 2) Configure the registry with cozy-registry.yml \u00b6 Before running the registry, you have to configure it correctly. Don\u2019t worry, here is the .yaml file to copy and paste in your cozy-registry.yml (should be in the root folder of cozy-registry/ ): :bulb: You can find an example of this configuration file at the root of the directory. # server host (serve command) - flag --host host : \"localhost\" # server port (serve command) - flag --port port : 8081 couchdb : # CouchDB server url - flag --couchdb-url url : http://localhost:5984 # CouchDB user - flag --couchdb-user user : '' # CouchDB password - flag --couchdb-password password : '' # CouchDB prefix for the registries databases - flag --couchdb-prefix prefix : registry1 swift : # Swift auth URL (provided by keystone) auth_url : http://172.28.128.3/identity/v3 # Swift username username : admin # Swift password api_key : secret # Endpoint type (public/admin/internal) endpointy_type : public # Project name tenant : demo # Swift domain domain : default # Path to the session secret file containing the master secret to generate # session token. # # Should be generated with the \"gen-session-secret\" command. session-secret : sessionsecret.key Feel free to change it if some configurations change in your case (the couchdb user, the server parameters or the databases prefix for example). Notices : - Here the generated session token (step 1) is stored in the sessionsecret.key file of the working directory, this is so the value of the property session-secret at the end of the configuration file. - By default, the local couchdb allow all admin accesses without creating users, so there is no user and password here. But if an admin user has been created, you have to use the properties user and password in the couchdb part to provide these informations. It\u2019s also possible to use env variables for configuration. You can take the key from the configuration file and add the COZY_REGISTRY prefix. For example, you can run: COZY_REGISTRY_PORT = 8081 cozy-apps-registry serve There is also the REGISTRY_SESSION_PASS env variable for the password for the session secret. 3) Run the registry to serve the apps \u00b6 Run the registry using this followed command (here our configuration file is a cozy-registry.yml in the current working directory): cozy-apps-registry serve -c cozy-registry.yml At this step, you should have a cozy-apps-registry running and ready for the development. If you runnig the registry for the first time you can see the next steps to create a new editor and to configure your local cozy-stack to run with this new registry. The -c options is always mandatory if you want to specify a config file like here. 4) Create an editor \u00b6 This step is required to submit new applications in the registry. In another terminal, run these commands to create an editor (the one that will submit the application(s)) and generate an access token: cozy-apps-registry add-editor Cozy -c cozy-registry.yml cozy-apps-registry gen-token --master Cozy -c cozy-registry.yml Here we go, you have now an registry ready and running on the 8081 port. The -c options is always mandatory if you want to specify a config file like here. 5) Configure cozy-stack with the registry \u00b6 On the cozy-stack , you have to add the new registry in the stack configuration file cozy.yaml (registries property): ... registries : default : - http://localhost:8081/ ... Now restart your local cozy-stack to take this new configuration in consideration (stop and run again cozy-stack serve ) and you\u2019re ready to work with the cozy-apps-registry ! Publish your application on the registry \u00b6 If you need more details about the registry you can go to the official registry documentation :warning: Important: In this whole documentation, by the term application , we mean a web application or a konnector. Indeed, for the registry, all entities are applications and they can be either webapp or konnector type. 1) Prepare your application \u00b6 For an application \u00b6 To be publishable, your application requires some informations in its manifest.webapp , the manifest of a Cozy application. Here is an example for the application Drive: \u0002wzxhzdk:7\u0003 For a connector \u00b6 To be publishable, your konnector requires some informations in its manifest.konnector , the manifest of a Cozy konnector. Here is an example for the konnector cozy-konnector-trainline : \u0002wzxhzdk:8\u0003 Properties meaning (reference) \u00b6 Here are all properties meaning for the manifest file (for webapp and konnectors) sorted alphabetically: Field Description aggregator Object containing aggregator data. Typically { accountId: 'aggregator-service' } . categories array of categories for your apps (see authorized categories), it will be ['others'] by default if empty data_types (konnector specific) Array of the data type the konnector will manage developer name and url for the developer editor the editor\u2019s name to display on the cozy-bar ( REQUIRED ) fields (konnector specific) JSON object describing the fields need by the konnector ( except folder path ). Used to generate a form. See collect documentation folders (konnector specific) A list of folders required by the konnector to store files according to datatype (see the specific documentation below ) frequency (konnector specific) A human readable value between monthly , weekly , daily , indicating the interval of time between two runs of the konnector. Default : weekly . icon path to the icon for the home (path in the build) intents (application specific) a list of intents provided by this app (see cozy-stack intents doc for more details) langs Languages available in your app (can be different from locales) language (konnector specific) the konnector development language used (ex: node ) license the SPDX license identifier locales an object with language slug as property, each name property is an object of localized informations (see the second part below) manifest_version The current manifest version used. This is a versioning for the manifest and allow better retrocompatiblity when processing app manifest messages (konnector specific) Array of message identifiers, which can be used by application to display information at known areas. See example in collect documentation . name the name to display on the home ( REQUIRED ) name_prefix the prefix to display with the name oauth (konnector specific) JSON object containing oAuth information, like scope . If a manifest provides an oauth property, it is considered as an OAuth konnector. parameters (konnector specific) Additional parameters which should be passed to the konnector. Used for example for bank konnectors to pass a bankId parameter. partnership an object to provide informations (to display in the Store for example) about a partnership related to the application ( icon description , name and domain ) permissions a map of permissions needed by the app (see see cozy-stack permissions doc for more details) platforms (application specific) List of objects for platform native applications. For now there are only two properties: type (i.e. 'ios' or 'linux' ) and the optional url to reach this application page. routes (application specific) a map of routes for the app (see cozy-stack routes doc for more details) ( REQUIRED ) screenshots an array of paths to the screenshots of the application (paths in the build) services (application specific) a map of the services associated with the app (see cozy-stack services doc for more details) slug the default slug that should never change (alpha-numeric lowercase) ( REQUIRED ) source where the files of the app can be downloaded (by default it will look for the branch build ) tags a list a tags describing your application and features (useful for indexing and search) terms an object defining properties for terms that need to be displayed/accepted by the user when installing the application ( more-info-below ) time_interval (konnector specific) By defaults, konnector triggers are scheduled randomly between 00:00 AM and 05:00 AM. Those two values can be overwritten thanks to this property, by passing an array containing two values: first is the interval start hour, second is the interval end hour. Example: [15, 21] will randomly schedule the konnector trigger between 15:00 (03:00 PM) and 21:00 (09:00 PM). The time zone used is GMT. type type of application ( konnector or webapp ) ( REQUIRED ) version the current version number ( REQUIRED ) vendor_link (konnector specific) URL to editor or service website Notices: - All images paths ( icon , partnership.icon and screenshots ) should be relative to the build directory. For example, here, the icon.svg is stored in the build root directory and all screenshots are store in a folder screenshots in the build directory. Therefore, if you use a bundler (like webpack) be sure to know exactly where the bundler will store these assets in the build directory (and change it in the manifest if needed). - All properties in locales objects will override the matched property of the main manifest.webapp body, if a property is not found in locales it will fallback to the main body one. - We use to have the en locale as default one if the one wanted by the user doesn\u2019t exist. Be sure to have, at least, that locale complete with the name and all descriptions. - In your build files, this manifest.webapp file must be at the root. Translated manifest fields \u00b6 Here are the properties that you can override using locales (we recommand to automatically build these properties according to your locales files if you\u2019re using a translating tool like transifex ) : name short_description long_description changes screenshots folders Application terms \u00b6 You can provide a related terms property if you want to display and make the user accept some terms (ToS for example) just before installing the application. Here are all properties allowed and used: url , the URL of the terms/contract to redirect the user to ( REQUIRED ) version : A specific version of the terms, we need it handle terms updates and ask the user again to accept the update. The special characters [*+~.()'\"!:@] are not allowed here. ( REQUIRED ) id : An id for the terms. When accepting terms, we store in io.cozy.terms , a document containing the id and version so that we know which terms have been accepted, and show the user a modal if the terms have not been accepted yet. The special characters [*+~.()'\"!:@] are not allowed here. ( REQUIRED ) Konnectors folders handling \u00b6 The folders property is a list of objects with these following properties: defaultDir : ( REQUIRED ) The default root directory of your folder. In this folder will automatically be created a subfolder with the konnector name and into this latter a subfolder with the account name to store the related files. Here you can use some variables in the path like the following: $administrative : Folder which will receive all administrative related files (bills, contracts, invoices\u2026) $photos : Folder which will receive all photos $konnector : The name of the konnector :warning: All paths provided using defaultDir will be the root directory, not the final folder which will receive the files. For example, if you set $photos , the final folder will be $photos/$konnector/$account in order to keep them always sorted by konnectors and accounts. 2) Add a new application in the registry \u00b6 Our official apps registry \u00b6 Official registry URL: https://apps-registry.cozycloud.cc In order to use our official repository, you need a token for a specific editor. To do so, contact us directly at the address contact@cozycloud.cc with a mail using the following title prefix: [registry] and provide us these folowing information (not changeable after): - slug of your application - editor name that you want We will provide you with the correct token. Custom registry \u00b6 See the details below to know how to add a new application in a custom cozy-apps-registry instance (local or not). Prequisites : - For this step, you will need your editor token access generated when you created your editor (see below ). You have to replace all {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} in this documentation by this token. - The communication with the registry is done through HTTP requests for now. So we will use the curl command line tool to register our application here. Now you can add your application in the registry. This step is splitted in two septs: - Add a new application (without versions) - Add a version of the application :pushpin: A new application without registered version won\u2019t be displayed by the cozy-store application . To add a new application, you have to do a POST request which all the informations needed to the route registryAddress/registry with registryAddress your registry address (for example here http://localhost:8081 ). Let\u2019s add the Collect application as example: # {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} -> your generated editor access token curl -X \"POST\" \"http://localhost:8081/registry\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Token {{EDITOR_TOKEN}}\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d $'{ \"slug\": \"collect\", \"type\": \"webapp\", \"editor\": \"{{EDITOR}}\" }' Field Description slug your application unique ID type kind of application (it can be only webapp or konnector ) editor Name of the editor matching the {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} :warning: Here the slug is the unique ID of the application in the registry, so it can\u2019t be changed after the application is already registered. 3) Add a new version of a registered application \u00b6 Via cozy-app-publish (highly recommanded) \u00b6 Here we will show the classical way to add a version using the manual mode of cozy-app-publish as reference. But you may need to look at the Automation CI part of this documentation instead. Prequisites : - For this step, you will need your editor token access generated when you created your editor (see below ). You have to replace all {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} in this documentation by this token. - Don\u2019t forget to build your application first (run yarn build ), cozy-app-publish will read the manifest from your build Firstly, install the cozy-app-publish package using yarn or npm : yarn add cozy-app-publish --dev You can also install the package as a global package, but don\u2019t forget to update it frequently Then use it to publish your application, here is an example for collect : yarn cozy-app-publish \\ --token {{ EDITOR_TOKEN }} \\ --build-url https://github.com/cozy/cozy-collect/archive/042cef26d9d33ea604fe4364eaab569980b500c9.tar.gz \\ --manual-version 1.0.2-dev.042cef26d9d33ea604fe4364eaab569980b500c9 If you need more information about this tool, you can go to the official cozy-app-publish documentation . Via curl \u00b6 Here we will show the classical way to add a version using curl as reference. But you may need to look at our dedicated tool cozy-app-publish or the Automation CI part of this documentation instead. Prequisites : - For this step, you will need your editor token access generated when you created your editor (see below ). You have to replace all {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} in this documentation by this token. - The communication with the registry is done through HTTP requests for now. So we will use the curl command line tool to register our application here. To add a new application, you have to do a POST request which all the informations needed to the route registryAddress/registry/:appSlug with registryAddress your registry address (for example here http://localhost:8081 ), :appName your application slug (here drive ). Let\u2019s add the version 1.0.1 of the Collect application as example: # {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} -> your generated editor access token curl -X \"POST\" \"http://localhost:8081/registry/collect\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Token {{EDITOR_TOKEN}}\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d $'{ \"url\": \"https://github.com/cozy/cozy-collect/archive/1.0.1.tar.gz\", \"sha256\": \"96212bf53ab618808da0a92c7b6d9f2867b1f9487ba7c1c29606826b107041b5\", \"version\": \"1.0.1\", \"type\": \"webapp\", \"editor\": \"{{EDITOR}}\" }' Field Description url the archive source of your application, it will be downloaded and checked with the sha256 property sha256 the sha256 hash of your source archive matching the archive in url (see the notice below) version version of the application, must match the one in the manifest (see the notice below) type kind of application (it can be only webapp or konnector ) editor Name of the editor matching the {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} :warning: Important notices: - The version must match the one in the manifest.webapp file for stable release. For beta (X.X.X-betaX) or dev releases (X.X.X-dev.hash256), the version before the cyphen must match the one in the manifest.webapp . - For better integrity, the sha256 provided must match the sha256 of the archive provided in url . If it\u2019s not the case, that will be considered as an error and the version won\u2019t be registered. Spaces & Virtual Spaces \u00b6 Spaces \u00b6 You can divide your applications between several isolated places, called spaces . When an application and its versions are published in a space , they are only reachable in that one (you can consider a space like a entire sub-part of the registry). It is espacially useful for splitting up applications by logical topics. Most of the CLI and API endpoints have a space option. You can refer to the documentation or CLI help to view all available parameters. Create a space \u00b6 Spaces are defined in the config file and are automatically created during registry launching. Add a space entry, followed by your spaces names, and let the registry do the work: spaces : __default__ myspace foospace Remove a space \u00b6 To remove a space, you have to clean all the remaining apps & versions before removing the space entry name. A CLI is available for the job: $ cozy-apps-registry rm-space <your-space> Example: $ cozy-apps-registry rm-space foobar Warning: You are going to remove space foobar and all its applications. This action is irreversible. Please enter the space name to confirm: foobar Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.f26bf2b8db3da459071a074a1367ce36e78bb34c Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.cf1efba4c1b6dd08bb5857f5752790f0d2663d6d Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.0bbd57a6ce50af82cfbefb8c231fbfe04516e742 Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.21338229a0c2317dc0f3b94e92b22a367f84c537 Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.08ab3624136fb70dc996003aebc3049af51f7438 Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.4e9d174a3b01acaf8a44b561455efc3f34871142 Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.b2654bf00be393aa611fcbb7f70a8ef671895a84 Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.860861868a5dfe294c7120d81fa9feb5387bb57f Removing app2/0.1.9-dev.954dac9e12e080d591cb76591c311611fed1bea9 You can now delete the name from your config file. Virtual Spaces \u00b6 A virtual space is necessarily built over an existing space . It allows to filter by selecting or rejecting applications available on the underlying space. :warning: Please note that a virtual space does not have any database document or associated swift object, it does only enforce filters on a space . Therefore, it is not possible to publish applications or versions on a virtual space . Automation (CI) \u00b6 The following tutorial explains how to connect your continuous integration based on Travis to automatically publish new versions on the apps registry. In this tutorial, we assume: you have a token allowing you to publish applications for your editor : {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} you are working on a repository plugged on travis and named on github myname/cozy-example You first need to add the token to your travis configuration file .travis.yml . To do so, you need the travis utility to encrypt its value. $ travis encrypt REGISTRY_TOKEN ={{ EDITOR_TOKEN }} -r myname/cozy-example --org Please add the following to your .travis.yml file: secure: \"jUAjk..LOOOOONG_ENCRYPTED_STRING.....jdk89=\" Like said, you need to add this block of ciphered data in the .travis.yml (if it\u2019s not already done automatically). This will allow you to use the REGISTRY_TOKEN variable in your deployment script. Then, you can add the publish script in your package.json in order to be used by Travis: ... \"publish:cozy\" : \"git fetch origin ${DEPLOY_BRANCH:-build}:${DEPLOY_BRANCH:-build} && cozy-app-publish --token $REGISTRY_TOKEN --build-commit $(git rev-parse ${DEPLOY_BRANCH:-build})\" ... This script will fetch your last commit from the build branch to publish to the registry. If you push a tag, be sure to wait the last build branch Travis build finished in order to have the real last commit to publish. Finally, you can add this script to your .travis.yml to publish your app using our publishing tool cozy-app-publish during the deploy process: ... before_deploy: - yarn add cozy-app-publish deploy: - provider: script repo: myname/cozy-example skip-cleanup: true script: export DEPLOY_BRANCH=build && yarn deploy && yarn publish:cozy on: branch: master - provider: script repo: myname/cozy-example skip-cleanup: true script: export DEPLOY_BRANCH=build && yarn publish:cozy on: tags: true ... Important notices: - A commit push to the branch master will publish your application in the dev channel of the registry. - A tag push (Github release) will publish a stable version (ex: 1.0.0 ) or a beta version (ex: 1.0.1-beta2 ) to the registry (automatically handled by the registry). - cozy-app-publish will use the github archive URL computing to get the application tarball. If your applicaiton is not on Github, you may need to use the manual mode of the command. Access to our official apps registry \u00b6 Official registry URL: https://apps-registry.cozycloud.cc In order to use our official repository, you need a token for a specific editor. To do so, contact us directly at the address contact@cozycloud.cc with a mail using the following title prefix: [registry] and provide us these folowing information (not changeable after): - slug of your application - editor name that you want We will provide you with the correct token. Access control and tokens \u00b6 The read-only routes of the registry are all public and do not require any access-contre. However routes allowing to create applications and versions have access-control policies associated to them. The registry has two types of access permissions, that are associated to two different tokens: editor tokens : these tokens give access to the publication of new versions on the registry, for a specific editor name, at these conditions: the version\u2019s application must already exist in the registry the version\u2019s application must have the same \u201ceditor\u201d value as the token master tokens : these tokens are allowed to create and register new applications on the registry, and associate them with an existing editor name. They also have the same accesses as the editor tokens. Editor tokens can be specific to one or more applications names that they are allowed to publish. In order to create tokens, the binary offers a gen-token command-line. Here are some examples to illustrates some usages: # Generating tokens # generate an editor token for the editor \"cozy\", for any application $ cozy-apps-registry gen-token cozy # generate an editor token for the editor \"cozy\" expiring after 30 days $ cozy-apps-registry gen-token cozy --max-age 30d # generate an editor token for the editor \"cozy\" for application \"collect\" and \"drive\" $ cozy-apps-registry gen-token cozy --apps collect,drive # generate a master token associated with the editor \"cozy\" expiring after 30 days $ cozy-apps-registry gen-token cozy --master --max-age 30d # Verifying tokens # verify the editor token \"XXX\" for the editor \"cozy\" $ cozy-apps-registry verify-token cozy \"XXX\" # verify the master token \"XXX\" associated with the editor \"cozy\" $ cozy-apps-registry verify-token cozy \"XXX\" --master # Revoking tokens # revoke all editors tokens for the cozy editor $ cozy-apps-registry revoke-tokens cozy # revoke all master tokens associated with the cozy editor $ cozy-apps-registry revoke-tokens cozy --master Maintenance \u00b6 In order to set/unset an application into maintenance mode, the binary offers a maintenance command-line. Here are some examples of how to use it: # Activate maintenance mode for the application 'bank' of space 'myspace' # Available flagged options: # --infra specify a maintenance specific to our infra # --no-manual-exec specify a maintenance disallowing manual execution # --short specify a short maintenance $ cozy-apps-registry maintenance activate bank --space myspace # Deactivate maintenance mode for the application 'bank' of space 'myspace' $ cozy-apps-registry maintenance deactivate bank --space myspace Or using a cURL request and a master token: curl -XPUT \\ -H \"Authorization: Token $COZY_REGISTRY_ADMIN_TOKEN \" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"flag_infra_maintenance\": false,\"flag_short_maintenance\": false,\"flag_disallow_manual_exec\": false,\"messages\": {\"fr\": {\"long_message\": \"Bla bla bla\",\"short_message\": \"Bla\"},\"en\": {\"long_message\": \"Yadi yadi yada\",\"short_message\": \"Yada\"}}}' \\ https://apps-registry.cozycloud.cc/myspace/registry/maintenance/bank/activate curl -XPUT \\ -H \"Authorization: Token $COZY_REGISTRY_ADMIN_TOKEN \" \\ https://apps-registry.cozycloud.cc/registry/maintenance/bank/deactivate Application confidence grade / labelling \u00b6 The confidence grade of an applications can be specified by specifying the data_usage_commitment and data_usage_commitment_by fields of the application document. Possible values for these properties are: data_usage_commitment : specify a technical commitment from the application editor: user_ciphered : technical commitment that the user\u2019s data is encrypted and can only be known by him. user_reserved : commitment that the data is only used for the user, to directly offer its service. none : no commitment data_usage_commitment_by : specify what entity is taking the commitment: cozy : the commitment is taken by cozy editor : the commitment is taken by the application\u2019s editor none : no commitment is taken To do that, a command line and admin API are available, and be used as follow: $ cozy-apps-registry modify-app banks --space my_space --data-usage-commitment user_reserved --data-usage-commitment-by editor Or using a cURL request and a master token: curl -XPATCH \\ -H\"Authorization: Token $COZY_REGISTRY_ADMIN_TOKEN\" \\ -H\"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d'{\"data_usage_commitment\": \"user_reserved\", \"data_usage_commitment_by\": \"editor\"} https://apps-registry.cozycloud.cc/my_space/registry/banks Universal links \u00b6 The registry can manage Universal links . Configuration \u00b6 Config file \u00b6 Each space holds its own files. The space determination is based on the request host, so you must bind a domain to a space in the config file. domain_space : mycloud.com : \"__default__\" cloud.foobar.com : \"foobar\" Files \u00b6 Place your files (e.g apple-app-site-association ) in the space container. The file must be prepended with universallink/ For the foobar space and file apple-app-site-association , the file has to be named universallink/apple-app-site-association and placed in the foobar container Usage \u00b6 The following endpoint is available to get any file: http://<yourdomain>/.well-known/:filename You can now query your endpoint to get your file: curl -X GET http://cloud.foobar.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association { \"applinks\" : { \"apps\" : [] , \"details\" : [ { \"appID\" : \"3AKXFMV43J.io.cozy.drive.mobile\" , \"paths\" : [ \"/drive\" ] } , { \"appID\" : \"3AKXFMV43J.io.cozy.banks.mobile\" , \"paths\" : [ \"/banks\" ] } , { \"appID\" : \"3AKXFMV43J.io.cozy.photos.mobile\" , \"paths\" : [ \"/photos\" ] } ] } } Community \u00b6 You can reach the Cozy Community by: Chatting with us on IRC #cozycloud on Freenode Posting on our Forum Posting issues on the Github repos Say Hi! on Twitter","title":"README"},{"location":"/cozy-apps-registry/README/#cozy-apps-registry","text":"","title":"cozy-apps-registry"},{"location":"/cozy-apps-registry/README/#whats-cozy","text":"Cozy is a platform that brings all your web services in the same private space.

How-to integrate with an existing store ? \u00b6 cozy-client uses redux internally to centralize the statuses of the various fetches and replications triggered by the library, and to store locally the data in a normalized way. If you already have a redux store in your app, you can configure cozy-client to use this existing store: import CozyClient from 'cozy-client' import { combineReducers , createStore , applyMiddleware } from 'redux' import myReducers from './myapp/reducers' import myMiddleware from './myapp/middleware' const client = new CozyClient ({ /*...*/ }) const store = createStore ( combineReducers ({ ... myReducers , cozy : client . reducer () }), applyMiddleware ( myMiddleware ) ) ReactDOM . render ( < CozyProvider client = { client } store = { store }> < MyApp /> </ CozyProvider >, document . getElementById ( 'main' ) ) How to use the client on Node environment ( ReferenceError: fetch is not defined ) ? \u00b6 Cozy-Client relies on the fetch function included in browsers (or polyfilled). This function does not exist on Node environments so we have to provide a polyfill. An example using node-fetch : import fetch from 'node-fetch' import CozyClient from 'cozy-client' global . fetch = fetch Then you will be able to use all the client methods and fetch data correctly. How to connect to the documents store declaratively ? \u00b6 Sometimes, HOCs are better suited than render-prop components, especially if you have multiple data-sources and you do not want to have multiple indent levelves. We provide a higher-order component called queryConnect . Basic example of usage: import React from 'react' import { queryConnect } from 'cozy-client' const query = client => client . find ( 'io.cozy.todos' ). where ({ checked : false }) const TodoList = ({ todos }) => todos . fetchStatus !== 'loaded' ? < h1 > Loading ...</ h1 > : < ul >{ todos . data . map ( todo => < li >{ todo . label }</ li >)}</ ul > export default queryConnect ({ todos : { query : query , as : 'todos' } })( TodoList ) When we use queryConnect to bind a query to a component, three things happen: - The queries passed as an argument will be executed when the component mounts, resulting in the loading of data from the client-side store, or the server if the data is not in the store ; - Our component subscribes to the store, so that it is updated if the data changes ; - props are injected into the component: if we were to declare propTypes they would look like this: TodoList . propTypes = { todos : PropTypes . shape ({ fetchStatus : PropTypes . string . isRequired , data : PropTypes . array }) } You can also connect multiples queries by adding other properties to the object passed to queryConnect : import { queryConnect } from 'cozy-client' import React from 'react' import TodoList from './TodoList' import Contacts from './Contacts' const App = ({ todos , contacts }) => ( < div > { todos . fetchStatus !== 'loaded' ? < p > Loading ...</ p > : < TodoList items = { todos . data } />} { contacts . fetchStatus !== 'loaded' ? < p > Loading ...</ p > : < Contacts items = { contact . data } />} </ div > ) export default queryConnect ({ todos : { query : client => client . all ( 'io.cozy.todos' ), as : 'todos' }, contacts : { query : client => client . all ( 'io.cozy.contacts' ), as : 'contact' } })( App ) Finally, queryConnect also allows us to make queries based on props by passing a function instead of a plain object. For example, if we want to fetch todos based on a selected contact: queryConnect ({ todos : props => ({ query : client => client . all ( 'io.cozy.todos' ). where ({ author : props . selectedContact }), as : 'todos' }) }) How to provide a mutation to a component ? \u00b6 withMutation provides only a simple function to the wrapper component, in a prop called mutate : import { withMutation } from 'cozy-client' const AddTodo = ({ mutate : createTodo }) => { let input return ( < form onSubmit = { e => { e . preventDefault () createTodo ( input . value ) input . value = '' }}> < input ref = { node => { input = node }} /> < button type = \"submit\" > Add Todo </ button > </ form > ) } export default withMutation ( label => client => client . create ( 'io.cozy.todos' , { label }) )( AddTodo ) How to specify a schema ? \u00b6 Each doctype accessed via cozy-client needs to have a schema declared. It is useful for Validation Relationships Automatic metadata maintenance Here is a sample of a schema used in the Banks application. const { HasMany } = require ( 'cozy-client' ) class HasManyBills extends HasMany { ... } class HasManyReimbursements extends HasMany { ... } const schema = { transactions : { doctype : 'io.cozy.bank.operations' , attributes : {}, relationships : { account : { type : 'belongs-to-in-place' , doctype : 'io.cozy.bank.accounts' }, bills : { type : HasManyBills , doctype : 'io.cozy.bills' }, reimbursements : { type : HasManyReimbursements , doctype : 'io.cozy.bills' } }, cozyMetadata : { createdByApp : { trigger : 'creation' , value : 'cozy-banks' }, updatedByApps : { trigger : 'update' , value : [ 'cozy-banks' ] }, createdAt : { trigger : 'creation' , useCurrentDate : true }, updatedAt : { trigger : 'update' , useCurrentDate : true }, } } } const client = new CozyClient ({ ... schema ... }) Relationships \u00b6 Here we can see that banking transactions are linked to their account via a \u201cbelongs to\u201d relationship bills via a custom \u201chas many\u201d relationship reimbursements via a custom \u201chas many\u201d relationship Custom relationships are useful if the relationship data is not stored in a built-in way. Metadata \u00b6 cozy-client will also automatically insert and update the standard document metadata. You may provide some info when you initialize the client: in the appMetadata parameter: slug : the app\u2019s slug sourceAccount : in case of the app is a connector, the io.cozy.accounts (defaults to null ) version : the app\u2019s version in the schema , for each doctype: doctypeVersion : the version of the doctype For example, to initialize the client for google connector that deals with io.cozy.contacts and io.cozy.contacts.accounts : const client = new CozyClient ({ schema : { contacts : { doctype : 'io.cozy.contacts' , doctypeVersion : 2 }, contactsAccounts : { doctype : 'io.cozy.contacts.accounts' , doctypeVersion : 1 } }, appMetadata : { slug : 'konnector-google' , sourceAccount : 'xxx' , // id of the io.cozy.accounts object version : 3 } }) Validation \u00b6 Validation is not yet implemented in cozy-client. How to activate logging ? \u00b6 Cozy-client libs use minilog for internal logging. If you need to see those logs, you need to tell minilog to show them, they are filtered by default. Each lib has a different namespace that can be enabled/disabled. For example if you want to allow cozy-pouch-link logs at debug level, you can do: require('minilog').suggest.allow('cozy-pouch-link', 'debug') If you want to see everything : require('minilog').suggest.clear() More info on minilog docs .","title":"How tos"},{"location":"/cozy-client/how-tos/#how-to-integrate-with-an-existing-store","text":"cozy-client uses redux internally to centralize the statuses of the various fetches and replications triggered by the library, and to store locally the data in a normalized way.

They are also responsible for building the QueryDefinition that is used by the client to automatically fetch relationship data. Hydrated documents used by components come with Association instances.

Accessing hydratedBook.author.data gives you the author from the store, for example : { \"name\" : \"St-Exupery\" , \"firstName\" : \"Antoine\" , \"_id\" : \"antoine\" } It is the responsibility of the relationship to decide how the relationship data is stored. For example, here since we use the default has-one relationship, the relationship data is stored in the relationships attribute of the original document (in our case here, our book would be { \"title\" : \"Le petit prince\" , \"relationships\" : { \"author\" : { \"data\" : { \"doctype\" : \"io.cozy.authors\" , \"_id\" : \"antoine\" } } } } In the case of an \u201cin-place\u201d relationship, the relationship data is stored directly under the attribute named by the relationship (in our case author ). Our book would be { \"title\" : \"Le petit prince\" , \"author\" : \"antoine\" } Each different type of Association may change: get raw : how the relationship data is stored (either as per the JSON API spec or in a custom way) get data : how the store documents are then fetched from the store to be added to the hydrated document (.data method). View components will access hydratedDoc[relationshipName].data . get query : how to build the query to fetch related documents Param Type Description target object Original object containing raw data name string Attribute under which the association is stored doctype string Doctype of the documents managed by the association options.dispatch function Store\u2019s dispatch, comes from the client options string association.target : object \u00b6 The original document declaring the relationship Kind : instance property of Association association.name : string \u00b6 The name of the relationship.

The second, thereafter named v3 is the new cozy-stack ( repository ). It\u2019s based on go and aim to support multiple user on a single process. v2 supported both server-side applications with their own node.js process and client-side applications which run in the user browser. v3 will not support server-side applications. We will support server side modules managed by server administrator, but the applications themselves will all be client-side application. This repository provides a library which allows you to build a client-side application compatible with both version. The former javascript library for making client-side application was cozy-browser-sdk . We aim to deprecate it once cozy-client-js reaches feature-parity. If you already have an application using cozy-browser-sdk , you can see what will change in the transition document . If you have any doubt, please open an issue!

If you are developing a client-side app for Cozy V3, you can import the lib directly from the stack, by using {{.CozyClientJS}} . Doctypes & Permissions \u00b6 A doctype is a simple javascript string identifying a type of document. Some basic doctypes are provided by cozy, but you can pick your own. Cozy v3 expects doctypes to be qualified to ensure uniqueness. All doctypes designed by the cozy\u2019s team will be prefixed with io.cozy. , or io.cozy.labs. Any doctype you introduce is expected to be prefixed with the reverse notation of a domain you own (JLS#7.7). If you do not own a domain, you can also use a reverse notation of your email address. You are free to reuse another applications documents by using their doctypes but you SHOULD discuss with the domain owner if you want to add fields or format them differently. To ensure retrocompatibility, when used on stack v2, all known doctypes will be auto-prefixed, but a warning will be written to the console. Unknown doctype will cause a fatal error. DO NOT rely on this behaviour in new applications, use qualified doctypes. // contacts is a doctype defined by cozy cozyContactsDoctype = \"io.cozy.contacts\" // your application handle books, let's create a doctype myBooksDoctype = \"com.mydomain.book\" When you use a doctype, even one created by your application, you need to ask for its permission in your manifest. How to do it depends on which stack you are developping for. TODO Have some docs about v2 package.json vs v3 manifest.webapp Promises & Callbacks \u00b6 All cozy-client-js functions support callback or promise. If no callback is provided, a promise is returned. cozy . client . data . create ( myBooksDoctype , doc ) . then ( function ( result ){ console . log ( 'done' , result ); }); . catch ( function ( err ){ console . log ( 'fail' , err ); }); If your build pipeline supports it, use async/await for sweet sweet async try { result = await cozy . client . data . create ( myBooksDoctype , doc ) console . log ( 'done' , result ) } catch ( err ) { console . log ( 'fail' , err ) } If for some reason you do not want to use promises, you can pass the disablePromises flag to the init function.

Before reading this document, to better understand how authentication and OAuth work on the cozy-stack, you should read this document . The library exposes internal methods to access the OAuth endpoints of the cozy-stack. See cozy.auth.* methods . However, the library also provides a more automated way to perform de OAuth flow by implementing many details of the OAuth registration and authorization flow for you. Here we describe the automated and stateful method. Storage \u00b6 To handle the workflow automatically, the user of the library shoud pass a storage object that will be used to store the OAuth client and tokens informations. This storage should implement the following \u201cinterface\u201d: interface Storage { load ( key : string ) : Promise < any > save ( key : string , value : any ) : Promise < any > delete ( key : string ) : Promise < boolean > clear () : Promise <> } The library provides two implementation of such storage: - cozy.auth.MemoryStorage storing data in-memory - cozy.auth.LocalStorage storage data in a html5 localStorage The library constructor (on init method) should be passed the storage in the storage field of the oauth options. Registration parameters \u00b6 In order to handle the registration of the client, two callbacks should be provided to the cozy-client-js instance. clientParams an object with the following parameters: redirectURI : the URI on which the user is redirected after accepting the client (mandatory) softwareID : identifier of the software (by default github.com/cozy/cozy-client-js ) softwareVersion : version of the software (optional) clientName : string (optional) clientKind : string (optional) clientURI : string (optional) logoURI : string (optional) policyURI : string (optional) scopes : array of key:value elements representing the permission scopes required by the application that the user should accept (mandatory) onRegistered(client, url) which should provide the wanted \u201cside effect\u201d after the client registration and return a promise containing the request URL provided by the user containing the access code and state.

It returns a modified Promise for the intent document, having a custom start(element) method. This method interacts with the DOM to append an iframe to the given HTML element. This iframe will provide an access to an app, which will serve a service page able to manage the intent action for the intent doctype. The start(element) method returns a promise for the result document provided by intent service. On Intent ready callback: This start method also takes a second optional argument which is a callback function ( start(element, onReadyCallback) ). When provided, this function will be run when the intent iframe will be completely loaded (using the onload iframe listener). This callback could be useful to run a client code only when the intent iframe is ready and loaded. An intent has to be created everytime an app need to perform an action over a doctype for wich it does not have permission. For example, the Cozy Drive app should create an intent to pick a io.cozy.contacts document. The cozy-stack will determines which app can offer a service to resolve the intent. It\u2019s this service\u2019s URL that will be passed to the iframe src property. Once the intent process is terminated by service, the iframe is removed from DOM. Example \u00b6 cozy . client . intents . create ( 'EDIT' , 'io.cozy.photos' , { action : 'crop' , width : 100 , height : 100 }) . start ( document . getElementById ( 'intent-service-wrapper' )) See cozy-stack documentation for more details.

It initializes communication with the parent window (remember: the service is supposed to be in an iframe). If intentId and window parameters are not provided the method will try to retrieve them automatically. It returns a service object, which provides the following methods : * compose(action, doctype, data) : request the client to make a second intent. This returns a promise fulfilled with the second intent result. js // ... const app = await service.compose('INSTALL', 'io.cozy.apps', { slug: 'drive' }) * getData() : returns the data passed to the service by the client. * getIntent() : returns the intent * resizeClient(doc, transitionProperty) : forces the size of the intent modale to a given width, maxWidth, height, maxHeight, or dimensions of a given element. The second optional argument transitionProperty can be used to add a CSS transition property on the intent in order to \u2018animate\u2019 the resizing. js // resize the client ot 300 pixels max height service.resizeClient({ maxHeight: 300 }, '.2s linear') // will be in css -> transition: .2s linear; // or service.resizeClient({ element: document.querySelector('.class') }) On intent size: If an intent is used by multiple applications, we don\u2019t use resizeClient(), since each application can have his own layout. You have to define the size of the intent in your application terminate(doc) : ends the intent process by passing to the client the resulting document doc . An intent service may only be terminated once. If a boolean exposeIntentFrameRemoval is found as true in the data sent by the client, the terminate() method will return an object with as properties a function named removeIntentFrame to remove the iframe DOM node (in order to be run by the client later on) and the resulting document doc . This could be useful to animate an intent closing and remove the iframe node at the animation ending. cancel() : ends the intent process by passing a null value to the client. This method terminate the intent service the same way that terminate() . throw(error) : throw an error to client and causes the intent promise rejection. Example \u00b6 cozy . client . intents . createService ( '77bcc42c-0fd8-11e7-ac95-8f605f6e8338' , window ) . then ( intentService => { const data = intentService . getData () // [...] // Do stuff with data // [...] const resultingDoc = { type : 'io.cozy.photos' , width : 100 , height : 100 } intentService . terminate ( resultingDoc ) }) cozy.client.intents.getRedirectionURL() \u00b6 cozy.client.intents.getRedirectionURL(doctype, data) retrieves a redirection URL for a given doctype, with specified data. It relies internally on a regular intent mechanism, which creates an intent for the REDIRECT action. It then build the redirection URL from URL sent by the stack and returns it. This URL can be used as link href for example, to show the doctype or the document in an application able to handle it. Example \u00b6 const myFolder = { folder : '4bce4649-e7b7-4226-d82e-6b87dbb684e7' } const url = await cozy . client . getRedirectionURL ( 'io.cozy.files' , myFolder ) // url is http://domain-app.cozy.rocks/#/files?folder=4bce4649-e7b7-4226-d82e-6b87dbb684e7 cozy.client.intents.redirect() \u00b6 cozy.client.intents.redirect(doctype, data) is based on cozy.client.intents.getRedirectionURL() and it redirects the browser to the retrieved URL.","title":"Intents API"},{"location":"/cozy-client-js/intents-api/#intents","text":"","title":"Intents"},{"location":"/cozy-client-js/intents-api/#cozyclientintentscreate","text":"cozy.client.intents.create(action, doctype [, data, permissions]) create an intent.

If a boolean exposeIntentFrameRemoval is found as true in the data sent by the client, the terminate() method will return an object with as properties a function named removeIntentFrame to remove the iframe DOM node (in order to be run by the client later on) and the resulting document doc . This could be useful to animate an intent closing and remove the iframe node at the animation ending. cancel() : ends the intent process by passing a null value to the client.

TWOFA_NEEDED_RETRY : The 2FA code provided by the user is wrong, the user can retry by providing a new one.

Will create io.cozy.bills objects. The default deduplication keys are ['date', 'amount', 'vendor'] . You need the full permission on io.cozy.bills , full permission on io.cozy.files and also full permission on io.cozy.bank.operations in your manifest, to be able to use this function. Parameters: documents is an array of objects with any attributes with some mandatory attributes : amount (Number): the amount of the bill used to match bank operations date (Date): the date of the bill also used to match bank operations vendor (String): the name of the vendor associated to the bill. Ex: \u2018trainline\u2019 currency (String) default: EUR: The ISO currency value (not mandatory since there is a default value. matchingCriterias (Object): criterias that can be used by an external service to match bills with bank operations. If not specified but the \u2018banksTransactionRegExp\u2019 attribute is specified in the manifest of the connector, this value is automatically added to the bill You can also pass attributes expected by saveFiles : fileurl, filename, requestOptions and more Please take a look at io.cozy.bills doctype documentation - fields (object) this is the first parameter given to BaseKonnector\u2019s constructor - options is passed directly to saveFiles , hydrateAndFilter , addData and linkBankOperations . Kind : Exported function Example const { BaseKonnector , saveBills } = require ( 'cozy-konnector-libs' ) module . exports = new BaseKonnector ( function fetch ( fields ) { const documents = [] // some code which fills documents return saveBills ( documents , fields , { identifiers : [ 'vendor' ] }) }) saveFiles \u00b6 Saves the given files in the given folder via the Cozy API. saveFiles() \u23cf \u00b6 Saves the files given in the fileurl attribute of each entries You need the full permission on io.cozy.files in your manifest to use this function. files is an array of object with the following possible attributes : fileurl: The url of the file (can be a function returning the value). Ignored if filestream is given filestream: the stream which will be directly passed to cozyClient.files.create (can also be function returning the stream) requestOptions (object) : The options passed to request to fetch fileurl (can be a function returning the value) filename : The file name of the item written on disk. This attribute is optional and as default value, the file name will be \u201csmartly\u201d guessed by the function. Use this attribute if the guess is not smart enough for you, or if you use filestream (can be a function returning the value). shouldReplaceName (string) used to migrate filename. If saveFiles find a file linked to this entry and this file name matches shouldReplaceName , the file is renames to filename (can be a function returning the value) shouldReplaceFile (function) use this function to state if the current entry should be forced to be redownloaded and replaced. Usefull if we know the file content can change and we always want the last version. fileAttributes (object) ex: {created_at: new Date()} sets some additionnal file attributes passed to cozyClient.file.create fields (string) is the argument given to the main function of your connector by the BaseKonnector. It especially contains a folderPath which is the string path configured by the user in collect/home options (object) is optional. Possible options : timeout (timestamp) can be used if your connector needs to fetch a lot of files and if the stack does not give enough time to your connector to fetch it all. It could happen that the connector is stopped right in the middle of the download of the file and the file will be broken. With the timeout option, the saveFiles function will check if the timeout has passed right after downloading each file and then will be sure to be stopped cleanly if the timeout is not too long. And since it is really fast to check that a file has already been downloaded, on the next run of the connector, it will be able to download some more files, and so on. If you want the timeout to be in 10s, do Date.now() + 10*1000 . You can try it in the previous code. contentType (string or boolean) ex: \u2018application/pdf\u2019 used to force the contentType of documents when they are badly recognized by cozy. If \u201ctrue\u201d the content type will be recognized from the file name and forced the same way. concurrency (number) default: 1 sets the maximum number of concurrent downloads validateFile (function) default: do not validate if file is empty or has bad mime type validateFileContent (boolean or function) default false. Also check the content of the file to recognize the mime type Kind : Exported function Example await saveFiles ([{ fileurl : 'https://...' , filename : 'bill1.pdf' }], fields ) saveIdentity \u00b6 Helper to set or merge io.cozy.identities See https://github.com/cozy/cozy-doctypes/blob/master/docs/io.cozy.identities.md saveIdentity() \u23cf \u00b6 Set or merge a io.cozy.identities You need full permission for the doctype io.cozy.identities in your manifest, to be able to use this function. Parameters: contact (object): the identity to create/update as an object io.cozy.contacts accountIdentifier (string): a string that represent the account use, if available fields.login options (object): options which will be given to updateOrCreate directly : sourceAccount (String): id of the source account sourceAccountIdentifier (String): identifier unique to the account targetted by the connector. It is the login most of the time const { saveIdentity } = require ( 'cozy-konnector-libs' ) const identity = { name : 'toto' , email : { 'address' : 'toto@example.com' } } return saveIdentity ( identity , fields . login ) Kind : Exported function signin \u00b6 Provides an handy method to log the user in, on HTML form pages. On success, it resolves to a promise with a parsed body. signin() \u23cf \u00b6 Provides an handy method to log the user in, on HTML form pages. On success, it resolves to a promise with a parsed body. Errors: LOGIN_FAILED if the validate predicate is false INVALID_FORM if the element matched by formSelector is not a form or has no action attribute UNKNOWN_PARSING_STRATEGY if parse is not one of the accepted values: raw , cheerio , json . VENDOR_DOWN if a request throws a RequestError, or StatusCodeError It does not submit values provided through select tags, except if populated by user with formData . url is the url to access the html form formSelector is used by cheerio to uniquely identify the form in which to log in formData is an object { name: value, \u2026 } . It is used to populate the form, in the proper inputs with the same name as the properties of this object, before submitting it. It can also be a function that returns this object. The page at url would be given as argument, right after having been parsed through cheerio . parse allow the user to resolve signin with a preparsed body. The choice of the strategy for the parsing is one of : raw , json or cheerio . cheerio being the default. validate is a predicate taking three arguments statusCode , parsedBody and fullResponse . If it is false, LOGIN_FAILED is thrown, otherwise the signin resolves with parsedBody value. requestOpts allows to pass eventual options to the signin \u2018s requestFactory . It could be useful for pages using latin1 encoding for instance. Kind : Exported function Example == basic example : == const $ = signin ({ url : `http://quotes.toscrape.com/login` , formSelector : 'form' , formData : { username , password } }) If the behavior of the targeted website is not standard. You can pass a validate function which will allow you to: - detect if the credentials work or not -> LOGIN_FAILED - detect if actions from the user are needed -> USER_ACTION_NEEDED - detect if the targeted website is out -> VENDOR_DOWN Example const $ = signin ({ url : `http://quotes.toscrape.com/login` , formSelector : 'form' , formData : { username , password }, validate : ( statusCode , $ , fullResponse ) { if ( statusCode !== 200 ) return false // LOGIN_FAILED if ( $ ( '.cgu' ). length ) throw new Error ( 'USER_ACTION_NEEDED' ) if ( fullResponse . request . uri . href . includes ( 'error' )) throw new Error ( 'VENDOR_DOWN' ) } }) Do not forget that the use of the signin function is not mandatory in a connector and won\u2019t work if the signin page does not use html forms. Here, a simple POST request may be a lot more simple. solveCaptcha \u00b6 Use every possible means to solve a captcha. At the moment, Anticaptcha web service is used if any related secret key is found in COZY_PARAMETERS environment variable. solveCaptcha() \u23cf \u00b6 Use every possible means to solve a captcha.

It is not available for self-hosted instances. It will just do nothing in that case. The local model is based on the user manual categorizations. Each model adds two properties to the transactions: * The global model adds cozyCategoryId and cozyCategoryProba * The local model adds localCategoryId and localCategoryProba In the end, each transaction can have up to four different categories. An application can use these categories to show the most significant for the user. See https://github.com/cozy/cozy-doctypes/blob/master/docs/io.cozy.bank.md#categories for more informations. Kind : inner method of categorization Returns : Object - an object with a categorize method Example const { BaseKonnector , createCategorizer } = require ( 'cozy-konnector-libs' ) class BankingKonnector extends BaseKonnector { async saveTransactions () { const transactions = await this . fetchTransactions () const categorizer = await createCategorizer const categorizedTransactions = await categorizer . categorize ( transactions ) // Save categorizedTransactions } } categorization~categorize() \u21d2 Array.<Object> \u00b6 Initialize global and local models and categorize the given array of transactions Kind : inner method of categorization Returns : Array.<Object> - the categorized transactions See : createCategorizer for more informations about models initialization Example const { BaseKonnector , categorize } = require ( 'cozy-konnector-libs' ) class BankingKonnector extends BaseKonnector { async saveTransactions () { const transactions = await this . fetchTransactions () const categorizedTransactions = await categorize ( transactions ) // Save categorizedTransactions } } BaseKonnector \u00b6 The class from which all the connectors must inherit.

This attribute is optional and as default value, the file name will be \u201csmartly\u201d guessed by the function. Use this attribute if the guess is not smart enough for you, or if you use filestream (can be a function returning the value). shouldReplaceName (string) used to migrate filename.

Possible options : timeout (timestamp) can be used if your connector needs to fetch a lot of files and if the stack does not give enough time to your connector to fetch it all. It could happen that the connector is stopped right in the middle of the download of the file and the file will be broken. With the timeout option, the saveFiles function will check if the timeout has passed right after downloading each file and then will be sure to be stopped cleanly if the timeout is not too long. And since it is really fast to check that a file has already been downloaded, on the next run of the connector, it will be able to download some more files, and so on. If you want the timeout to be in 10s, do Date.now() + 10*1000 .

Objectives of this document \u00b6 The goals of this document are: Define a common way to store synchronization data for all konnector Propose a naive implementation for an abstract synchronisation data storing mechanism, provided by cozy-konnector-libs Propose a solution to synchronize every type of data or file, not only bills Taking the hydrateAndFilter function as basis, split it in three functions performing the following tasks : actual filtering, synchronization data hydratation and saving/updating current database document with correspondig external entries (the part done by the actual hydratation ) Storing synchronization data in documents \u00b6 Before saving any data or file, we will add in the relying document every synchronization data we will need. The added data will depend on how the service the konnector connects to retrieve entries and which information they gave us. Simple case, by id \u00b6 We suppose that in the most cases, we will face to entries provinding their own id attribute. The idea is to store it as synchronization data to be able to easily retrieve them later. To store synchronization data, we are using a sync attribute in document metadata attribute. Example: { \"metadata\" : { \"sync\" : { \"id\" : \"7ee401e841c94159addb47f190903139\" , \"konnector\" : \"trainline\" , \"last_sync\" : \"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 16:25:34 GMT\" } } } The expected information to be save is: field role id The id of the document, but given by the external service. If the external service does not provide any id or uuid, it could be interesting to generate one, with an hash of the file for example. konnector The slug of the konnector (Example: trainline , freemobile , cic ). This could be very useful to retrieve data synchronized with this konnector. last_sync Date of last synchronization, set to now() when storage is made. By multiple attributes \u00b6 If the external service does not provide any id attribute, we may need to use instead a list of attributes, for example firstname , lastname , dateofbirth . { \"metadata\" : { \"sync\" : { \"firstname\" : \"Claude\" , \"lastname\" : \"Causi\" , \"dateofbirth\" : \"06/12/1980\" } } } As we cannot be sure that we will have different data, it could be better to use a custom way of providing an unique identifier. By custom method \u00b6 When the external service does not provide any identifier, we have to use a custom method to generate one. It could be for example the filename or a hash generated with the document content. { \"metadata\" : { \"sync\" : { \"id:\" : \"customhash34FED5465645ABF54656FCB\" } } } Saving document based on synchronization strategy \u00b6 To solve the synchronization process we need to: be able to add synchronization data on any type of document be able to compare external entries to current database state * provide a default implementation while letting the contributors to define their own ones Adding synchronization data \u00b6 We should provide an addSyncData function could, which look like this (naive implementation, this piece of code needs to be improved to handle cases where synchronizationStrategy.idAttribute is an array or a function): const addSyncData = ( document , entry , synchronizationStrategy ) => { return { ... document , metadata : { ... document . metadata , id : entry [ synchronizationStrategy . idAttribute ] } } ```` Where `document` is the future document to save , `entry` the corresponding external entry , and `synchronizationStrategy` and object defining the synchronization properties and methods ( see below ). ### Filtering entries Now we have saved our documents in database with consistent synchronization metadata , we need to provide a way to filter external entries . We should provide a `filterEntriesToSynchronize` which returns a list of entries with new data or data to update . As `addSyncData` , this method will receive a `synchronizationStrategy` . The filtering algorithm should be based on the returned value of `synchronizationStrategy.shouldSave` and `synchronizationStrategy.shouldUpdate` . > \u26a0\ufe0f As the `synchronizationStrategy.shouldSave` and `synchronizationStrategy.shouldUpdate` will be asynchronous methods , `filterEntriesToSynchronize` should also be asynchronous . A naive example of `filterEntriesToSynchronize` implementation should be : ```js const filterEntriesToSynchronize = async (cozy, entries, synchronizationStrategy) = { const filtered = [] entries.forEach(entry => { // getExistingSynchronizedDocument needs to be implemented, it should retrieve // existing document from database, based on synchronization data. const existingDocument = cozy.getExistingSynchronizedDocument(entry, synchronizationStrategy) const toSave = await synchronizationStrategy.shouldSave(entry, existingDocument) const toUpdate = await synchronizationStrategy.shouldUpdate(entry, existingDocument) if (toSave || toUpdate) filtered.push(entry) }) return filtered } Synchronization strategy \u00b6 For our functions or methods dealing with synchronization, we pass a synchronizationStrategy object. Internally, we will use a default one but let the ability to contributors to pass their own ones. It is a simple object containing the following properties: Option Role disableSyncData (boolean) Disable storage of synchronization data. Default: false findLegacyDocument (function) Custom function which a konnector may use to look for a legacy document. Default is null . See below for more details. getSyncData (function) A mapping method returning additional synchronization data which have to be added to the document. idAttribute (string|Array|function) How the identifier attribute is named in the entry. Default value: id . See below for additional customization konnector Mandatory (string) The slug (or better, an uuid) of the current konnector. shouldSave (function) A method taking current entry and matching document in database to evaluate if an entry has to be saved in database. See below default method and customization. shouldUpdate (function) A method taking current entry and matching document in database to evaluate if a document must be updated with current entry. See below for default method and customization. findLegacyDocument \u00b6 If a document has not been saved yet with actual synchronization data, we will have no way to retrieve it, except by providing a findLegacyDocument function to saveEntry options. This signature of a findLegacyDocument function is: async function ( entry , cozy ) => { /* look for your document */ } ```` The `cozy` parameter is an instance of Cozy - Client . The idea is for example to retrive a document by its file path or any other accurate information . ### getSyncData This method returns any addtional synchronization data the konnector should need . Default method should be something returning an empty object or `null` . ```js (entry) => ({}) A konnector should provide its own method: { getSyncData : ( entry ) => ({ filename : entry . name }) } ``` ### idAttribute #### String Name of the id attribute in entry. Default is ` id `. If we want to use another name, we may use: ``` js saveFiles ( files , { idAttribute : 'uuid' }) Array \u00b6 This attribute may also be an array of string, defining each entry attribute which must be used for identifier. Example \u00b6 saveFiles ( files , { idAttribute : [ 'name' , 'author' , 'date' ]}) In this case, all fields are used in synchronization data. function \u00b6 When an entry does not provide an unique identifer, it is possible to use a function as idAttribute to customize the way the unique identifer is generated. Example \u00b6 addData ( file , { idAttribute : ( entry ) => hash ( entry )}) // hash() is a custom method hashing the current file. konnector \u00b6 The konnector attribute is used as a key reference to retrieve all document synchronized by this konnector. For now, the konnector option will be needed for every call. But it could be interesting to initialize some kind of runner with it, which may encapsulate all the cozy-konnector-libs functions. shouldSave \u00b6 The shouldSave function returns a boolean which indicate if the entry should be saved. The default method should be: async function shouldSave ( entry , existingDocument , cozy ) => { return Promise . resolve ( ! existingDocument ) } When calling this function, it is assumed that cozy-konnector-libs first queries the database for an exisring document, based on synchronization data and pass the document resulting the query to the shouldSave function, event if this document is null . We pass the whole document, and not only synchronization data, to let the contributors free on their way they are determining it a document should be saved. As a third parameter, a cozyClient instance is passed, it may be used by a konnector to perform another query. Because of this third parameter, the whole shouldSave method is asynchronous. shouldUpdate \u00b6 The shouldUpdate function acts exactly like shouldSave , except that it is used to determine if a document should be updated. By default, we make the choice to never update a document (except if it does not have synchronization data, see findLegacyDocument above). But some konnectors like Linxo related ones need to update existing documents. The default method is: async function shouldUpdate ( entry , existingDocument , cozy ) { // Update an existing document only if it does not have synchronization data const hasSyncData = !! existingDocument && !! existingDocument . metadata && !! existingDocument . metadata . sync return Promise . resolve ( ! hasSyncData ) } ```` ## Whole example As the way data are saved from `cozy-konnector-libs` differs based on data type , we let the saving mechanism to others functions or methods . For example , in existing codebase , bills are saved in a specific way , resulting in two documents in database . However , we could provide top - level functions or methods , like `synchronizeBills` or a more generic `synchronizeData` . Here is a whole and naive example of how `synchronizeBills` could be implemebted : ```js const synchronizeBills = async (cozy, entries, synchronizationStrategy) => { return await filteredEntries = await filterEntriesToSynchronize(cozy, entries, synchronizationStrategy) .then(filteredEntries => filteredEntries.map(entry => addSyncData(entry, synchronizationStrategy))) // existing saveBills method (with maybe some little changes) .saveBills(synchronizedDocuments) } Usage could be: synchronizeBills(cozy, entries, { findLegacyDocument: (entry, cozy) => { return cozy.files.statByPath(getEntryPath(entry)) }, getSyncData: (file) => ({ fileName: file.name }), idAttribute: 'uuid', konnector: 'myservice', shouldSave: (file) => { // For whatever reason we only save files created after 2010 return Promise.resolve(moment(file.creationDate).year().isAfter(2010)) }, shouldUpdate: (file, existingDocument) => { const hasBeenModified = moment(file.modificationDate).isAfter(existingDocument.metadata.sync.last_sync) return Promise.resolve(hasBeenModified) } }) Every synchronized document will contain: { \"metadata\" : { \"sync\" : { \"konnector\" : \"myservice\" , \"id\" : \"<entry_id>\" , \"last_sync\" : \"<now>\" , \"fileName\" : \"<fileName>\" } } }","title":"Synchronization"},{"location":"/cozy-konnector-libs/synchronization/#table-of-contents","text":"Konnector synchronisation data and options Problems Current usage Objectives of this document Storing synchronization data in documents Simple case, by id By multiple attributes By custom method Saving document based on synchronization strategy Adding synchronization data Filtering entries Synchronization strategy findLegacyDocument getSyncData Array Example function Example konnector shouldSave shouldUpdate Whole example","title":"Table of contents"},{"location":"/cozy-konnector-libs/synchronization/#konnector-synchronisation-data-and-options","text":"","title":"Konnector synchronisation data and options"},{"location":"/cozy-konnector-libs/synchronization/#problems","text":"Except bank konnectors which are already solving the addressed problem, all konnectors are currently processing data they are collecting in the same way: Get all data to synchronize Store it in CouchDB, even if it means overriding previously synchronized data.

This file should be named cozy.yaml or cozy.json depending on the format of your chosing, and should be present in one of these directories (ordered by priority): ./.cozy $HOME/.cozy /etc/cozy The path of the configuration file can also be define from an absolute path given by the --config (or -c ) flag of the cozy-stack command . Templating and Environment Variables \u00b6 It is possible to pass environnment variable to this configuration using the template language of golang , delimited by {{ and }} . The environment variables are available in the .Env variable. For instance the text {{.Env.COUCHDB_PASSPHRASE }} will be replaced by the value of the COUCHDB_PASSPHRASE environment variable. The template is evaluated at startup of the stack. Values and Example \u00b6 To see the detail of the available parameters available, you can see an example of configuration in the cozy.example.yaml file at the root of this repository. This file contains all the parameters and fields that can be used to configure the stack with some example values. Some fields can be overriden by the flags of the cozy-stack serve command . Stack endpoints \u00b6 By default, cozy-stack use plain-text & local socket for client ( localhost:8080 ) and admin ( localhost:6060 ) communications. If you want to control a remote stack or using TLS to secure communications, you can configure your cozy-stack client with the following CLI arguments or environment variables. Argument Env variable Default value Usage --host / --admin-host COZY_HOST / COZY_ADMIN_HOST localhost `[http[s]://] [: ]` --port / --admin-port COZY_PORT / COZY_ADMIN_PORT 8080 / 6060 COZY_HOST_TIMEOUT / COZY_ADMIN_TIMOUT 15s HTTP timeout to use Must be [a valid golang duration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) like `10s` or `1m` COZY_HOST_VALIDATE / COZY_ADMIN_VALIDATE true Enable HTTPS certificate validation Can also be set via host URL query part, like `https://localhost:6060?validate=false` COZY_HOST_CA / COZY_ADMIN_CA none CA file to use for HTTPS certificate validation Can also be set via host URL query part, like `https://localhost:6060?ca= ` COZY_HOST_CERT / COZY_ADMIN_CERT none Client certificate to use Can also be set via host URL query part, like `https://localhost:6060?cert= ` COZY_HOST_KEY / COZY_ADMIN_KEY none Client certificate to use Can also be set via host URL query part, like `https://localhost:6060?key= ` COZY_HOST_FINGERPRINT / COZY_ADMIN_FINGERPRINT none Hex-encoded SHA-256 key pinning to use Can also be set via host URL query part, like `https://localhost:6060?fp= ` You can get the fingerprint of a given certificate with `openssl x509 -in -pubkey | openssl pkey -pubin -outform der | openssl dgst -sha256 -hex` Or directly from a private key with `openssl pkey -in -pubout -outform der | openssl dgst -sha256 -hex` Administration secret \u00b6 To access to the administration API (the /admin/* routes), a secret passphrase should be stored in a cozy-admin-passphrase . This file should be in one of the configuration directories, along with the main config file. The passphrase is stored in a salted-hashed representation using scrypt. To generate this file, you can use the cozy-stack config passwd [filepath] command. This command will ask you for a passphrase and will create the cozy-admin-passphrase at the specified path. You can use the COZY_ADMIN_PASSWORD env variable if you do not want to type the passphrase each time you call cozy-stack . Example \u00b6 $ mkdir ~/.cozy && cozy-stack config passwd ~/.cozy/cozy-admin-passphrase Hashed passphrase will be writtent in ~/.cozy/cozy-admin-passphrase Passphrase: Confirmation: $ cat ~/.cozy/cozy-admin-passphrase scrypt $16384$8$1$936 bd62faf633b5f946f653c21161a9b $4 e0d11dfa5fc1676ed329938b11a6584d30e603e0d06b8a63a99e8cec392d682 Hooks \u00b6 Cozy-stack can run scripts on some events to customize it. The scripts must be in the hooks directory defined in the config, have a predefined name, and be executable. Then, they should be fired automatically. Let\u2019s the available hooks. The pre-add-instance hook is run just before creating an instance. It can prevent the command from running by exiting with non-zero status. It can be used to check the domain for example. It is called with the following parameter: the domain of the instance that will be created. The post-add-instance hook is run just after an instance has been created. installed. It can be used to setup DNS for this instance for example. It is called with the following parameter: the domain of the instance that has been created. The pre-remove-instance hook is run just before destroying an instance. It can prevent the command from running by exiting with non-zero status. It can be used to make a backup of the instance before destroying it. It is called with the following parameter: the domain of the instance that will be destroyed. The post-remove-instance hook is run just after an instance has been destroyed. It can be used to do some cleanup. It is called with the following parameter: the domain of the instance that has been destroyed. The pre-install-app hook is run just before installing an application, and can prevent the command from running by exiting with non-zero status. It is called with the following parameters: the instance on which the application will be installed the application name that will be installed. The post-install-app hook is run just after an application has been installed. It can be used for logging, notification, statistics, etc. It\u2019s also a good place to add a vhost for an application in the reverse-proxy configuration, with a TLS certificate. It is called with the following parameters: the instance on which the application has been installed the application name that has been installed. The pre-uninstall-app hook is run just before uninstalling an application, and can prevent the command from running by exiting with non-zero status. It is called with the following parameters: the instance on which the application will be uninstalled the application name that will be uninstalled. The post-uninstall-app hook is run just after an application has been uninstalled. It can be used for cleaning the configuration of the reverse- proxy for example. It is called with the following parameters: the instance on which the application has been uninstalled the application name that has been uninstalled. Customizing a context \u00b6 Intro \u00b6 In the config file of cozy-stack, it\u2019s possible to declare some contexts, that are a way to regroup some cozy instances to give similar configuration. For example, it is possible to give a default_redirection that will be used when the user logs into their cozy. You can find more example in the example config file. Assets \u00b6 The visual appearance of a cozy instance can be customized via some assets (CSS, JS, images). These assets can be inserted from the command-line with the cozy-stack config insert-asset command. Here are a small list of assets that you may want to customize: /styles/theme.css : a CSS file where you can override the colors and put other CSS rules /favicon-16x16.png and /favicon-32x32.png : the two variants of the favicon /apple-touch-icon.png : the same but for Apple /images/default-avatar.png : the image to use as the default avatar. /images/icon-cozy-home.svg : the home icon used and displayed by the cozy-bar.","title":"Configuration file"},{"location":"/cozy-stack/config/#configuration","text":"","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"/cozy-stack/config/#main-configuration-file","text":"You can configure your cozy-stack using a configuration file.

Tip: if you are debugging an external asset, you may find it practical to replace the file in debug-assets by a symlink from where you build this asset.

Pull Requests \u00b6 Workflow \u00b6 Pull requests are the primary mechanism we use to change Cozy. GitHub itself has some great documentation on using the Pull Request feature. We use the \u2018fork and pull\u2019 model described there. Step 1: Fork \u00b6 Fork the project on GitHub and check out your copy locally: \u26a0\ufe0f Be sure to clone outside the $GOPATH otherwise gomodules will not work (or use the GO111MODULE=on env variable to force the usage of go modules). $ git clone https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack.git $ cd cozy-stack $ git remote add fork git://github.com/username/cozy-stack.git Step 2: Branch \u00b6 Create a branch and start hacking: $ git checkout -b my-branch -t origin/master Step 3: Code \u00b6 Well, I think you know how to do that. Just be sure to follow the coding guidelines from the Go community (gofmt, Effective Go , comment the code, etc.). We are using goimports to format code, and golangci-lint to detect code smells.

Code organization \u00b6 The codebase of cozy-stack contains several packages, and it is quite easy to have circular import issues in go. To limit the risk, we have split the packages in several directories with some rules for the imports. In short, a package in this list should import other packages that are on the same line or below: main and cmd are the top level packages web is where we have the routers and handlers for web requests worker is where we define the workers for our job system model is for high-level internal packages (in general one package is used for one doctype) client is a small number of packages used for writing clients for the stack pkg is the low-level packages (most of those packages are just a couple of structs and functions). Note that tests/testutils can be used safely in web and worker packages. In model , it can be used but it is recommended to use a fake package for the tests if it is the case. For example, model/oauth/client_test.go is declared as package oauth_test . External assets \u00b6 The cozy-stack serve some assets for the client application. In particular, cozy-client-js and cozy-bar assets are listed in assets/external . To update them, you can open a pull request for this file.

A user can preview a sharing before accepting it if the application supports this option. Else, he/she will have only the description and rules to make his/her mind about accepting or refusing the sharing. The data is duplicated: it is both on the owner\u2019s cozy, and on the recipients\u2019 cozy (no cloud federation like NextCloud). The applications say what is shared, the stack synchronizes that. The stack does the low-level stuff and gives primitives to the applications. The applications must use them in a responsible manner, and in particular, to avoid transitivity issues. The CouchDB replication will be used to synchronize the documents. It means that the documents will be same on the owner and on the recipients (\u201csymetric sharing\u201d). For files and folders, the replicator will be customized to handle the specificities of the io.cozy.files doctype. The applications must be able to work with broken relationships between documents. The applications should know how to deal with CouchDB conflicts. At least, the default choice of a winner for conflicts by CouchDB should be acceptable if the applications don\u2019t do anything to detect and resolve conflicts. First safety principle: when a user B accepts a sharing from user A, the documents that were on the user B\u2019s cozy before the sharing are not sent to user A without an explicit action of user B (like moving a file to a shared directory). Second safety principle: when two users, A and B, are sharing documents, a change of a document on the user A\u2019s cozy can\u2019t make an exiting document of user B enter in the sharing. Setup of a sharing \u00b6 Step 1: the owner creates the sharing \u00b6 One person decides to share something with other people from an application on her cozy. In our example, Alice wants to share a todo list with her friends, Bob and Charlie, and it is done from the Todo application. The application calls the stack with the rules for this sharing and the identifiers of the contacts with whom to share. The stack persists an io.cozy.sharings document and sends an email to the recipients (Bob an Charlie). Step 2: a recipient accepts the sharing \u00b6 A recipient, let\u2019s say Bob, receives the email and clicks on the link. His browser shows him the Todo application on Alice\u2019s Cozy so that he can preview the todo list, and a modal asks him if he wants to continue the sharing acceptation workflow. If he does, a form will ask him what is the address of his Cozy (the form can be pre-filled if he has already accepted another sharing in the past). After he has filled the form and submitted it, he is redirected on his Cozy. If he is not logged in, he has to login first. Then, a page describes him how the sharing will work and what technical permissions it implies. It also asks him to confirm the sharing. If he accepts, his instance will send to Alice\u2019s instance the answer. Step 3: the initial replication starts \u00b6 Alice\u2019s Cozy instance creates token and sends them with other informations as the response of the answer request from Bob\u2019s instance. At this moment, both instances are ready to start to replicate data to the other instances. So, let\u2019s do the initial replication. Alice\u2019s instance starts to fill the io.cozy.shared database with all the documents that match a rule of the sharing (except the rules with local: true ), and create triggers for the future documents to be also added in this database (the exact triggers depend of the parameters of the rules). And, when done, it creates a job for the replicator, and setups a trigger for future changes in the io.cozy.shared start a replicator job. Bob\u2019s instance also checks if any document matches a sharing rule. In most cases, it won\u2019t. But in some very special cases (e.g. a previous revoked sharing on the same documents), there are some documents that match a rule. They are added to the io.cozy.shared database, but with a conflict flag. They won\u2019t be replicated unless Bob accepts to in his Todo application. Triggers are also added on Bob\u2019s instance for filling the io.cozy.shared database, and to call the replicator after that. Note: there will be a lock around the initial filling of the io.cozy.shared database to avoid concurrency issues if two recipients accept the sharing at the same time. Workflow \u00b6 Step 1: a todo item is added on Bob\u2019s Cozy, a trigger is fired and it adds the new document to the io.cozy.shared database Step 2: a debounced trigger on the io.cozy.shared database is used to start a replicator Step 3: the replicator does the following steps it queries a local document of the io.cozy.shared database to get the last sequence number of a successful replication with this sequence number, it requests the changes feed of io.cozy.shared with a filter on the sharing id the results is a list of document doctype + id + rev that is sent to Alice\u2019s Cozy Alice\u2019s Cozy checks which revisions are known, and send a response with the list of those that are not for each not known revision, Bob\u2019s Cozy send the document to Alice\u2019s Cozy (in bulk) and, if it\u2019s all good, it persists the new sequence number in the local document, as a start point for the next replication Step 4: the changes are put in the io.cozy.shared database on Alice\u2019s Cozy Step 5: it starts a replicator on Alice\u2019s Cozy Step 6: the replicator send the changes to Charlie\u2019s Cozy, all the cozy instances are synchronized again! Note: when a todo item is moved fron a shared todo list to a not shared todo list, the document in io.cozy.shared for the todo item is kept, and the sharing id is associated to the keyword removed inside it. The remove behavior of the sharing rule is then applied. Files and folders \u00b6 Why are they special? \u00b6 Files are special for several reasons. First and foremost, they have a binary attached to them that can be quite heavy. The stack also enforces some rules on them (e.g. a file can\u2019t be added to a deleted folder) and has some specific code for the tree nature of files and folders (e.g. a permission on a folder is inherited on all the files and folders inside it, even if they are several levels below). Thus, the workflow explained just before is not compatible with the files. As we need to introduce some code specific to the files, we have also wanted to improve the sharing of files. First, we don\u2019t want to force the recipients to put the shared folder at exactly the same place as the owner. In fact, we think that putting the shared folder in a folder called Shared with me is more friendly. We also think that a file that has been shared in the past but is no longer (the sharing has been revoked) can evolve on both the owner\u2019s cozy and on the recipients\u2019 cozy in different ways, and in such a case, it\u2019s more logical to consider them as different files. These two reasons implies, on a technical level, that the identifiers for files and folders are not the same on the owner and the recipients of a sharing. The replicator will translate the identifiers from one system to another during the replications. Of course, it will also translate the id in the sharing rules, and the dir_id to preserve the relationship between a file and its parent folder. The path attribute will be seen as a cache, and recomputed when a cozy instance receives a folder document from a sharing replication. We will continue to have a replication as close to the CouchDB replication as possible. It means we synchronize a state, and not looking for the history of operations like cozy-desktop does. It is less accurate and can lead more often to conflicts. The cozy instances are expected to be online most of the time and have a short delay for replications: we think that the conflicts will happen only on rares occasions. This make acceptable to take this shortcut. And, in case of conflicts, we will preserve the content of the files (no data loss), even if it means duplicating the files. How a sharing involving files works? \u00b6 When a sharing involves a rule on the io.cozy.files doctype, a folder is created on the recipients cozy where the files will be put. It is created inside the Shared with me folder by default, but can be moved somewhere else after that. The folder won\u2019t be synchronized its-self later, and if the folder is trashed, the sharing is automatically revoked. As it is not a reversible action, a confirmation is asked before doing that. Note: we will forbid the sharing of the root of the virtual file system, of the trash and trashed files/folders, and of the Shared with me folder. The step 3 described above, aka the replicator, will be more complicated for folders and files. First change, it will work on two phases: 1. what can be synchronized without transfering the binaries first, and 2. the synchronization of files with a binary attached. Second change, the replicator will acquire the Virtual File System lock on the cozy instance where it will write things to ensure the consistency of what it writes. Third change, before inserting a folder or file in the database, the replicator checks that its parent exists, and if it\u2019s not the case, it creates it. Last change, we will avoid CouchDB conflicts for files and folder by using a special conflict resolution process. Sequence diagram \u00b6 Conflict resolution \u00b6 We have several cases of conflicts: When two cozy instances have modified the same file concurrently Same for a folder When two files or folders are renamed concurrently to the same name inside the same directory When a file or folder is created or updated on cozy instance while the parent directory is trashed concurrently on another cozy instance. For 1. and 2., we will reconciliate the changes except for a file with two versions having a distinct binary (we rely on size and checksum to detect that). In such a case, we create a copy of the file with one version, while keeping the other version in the original file. For 3., we rename the file or folder with the smaller id . For 4., we restore the trashed parent, or recreate it if it the trash was emptied. Conflict with no reconciliation \u00b6 When a file is modified concurrently on two cozy instances, and at least one change involve the content, we can\u2019t reconciliate the modifications. To know which version of the file is the \u201cwinner\u201d and will keep the same identifier, and which version is the \u201closer\u201d and will have a new identifier, we compare the revisions and the higher wins. This conflict is particulary tricky to resolve, with a lot of subcases. In particular, we try to converge to the same revisions on all the instances for the \u201cwinner\u201d file (and for the \u201closer\u201d too). We have 3 sets of attributes for files: size and md5sum (they change when the content has changed) name and dir_id (they change when the file is moved or renamed) created_at , updated_at , tags , referenced_by , etc. For the first two sets, the operation on the Virtual File System will needs to reach the storage (Swift), not just CouchDB. For the third set, it\u2019s easy: we can do the change at the same time as another change, because these attributes are only used in CouchDB. But we can\u2019t do a change on the first two sets at the same time: the Virtual File System can\u2019t update the content and move/rename a file in the same operation. If we needs to do both, it will generate 2 revisions in CouchDB for the file. Note: you can see that using CouchDB-like replication protocol means that we have some replications that can look useless, just some echo to a writing. In fact, it is used to acknowledge the writing and is helpful for conflict resolutions. It may be conter-intuitive, but removing them will harm the stability of the system, even if they do nothing most of the time. Example 1 \u00b6 Here, Alice uploads a file on her Cozy. It creates two revisions for this file (it\u2019s what the Virtual File System does). Then, she shares the directory with this file to her friend Bob. When Bob accepts the sharing, the file is sent to his Cozy, with the same revision (2-2aa). Later, Bob renames the file. It creates a new revision (3-3aa). The change is replicated to Alice\u2019s Cozy. And we have a replication from Alice to Bob to ensure that every thing is fine. Even later, Alice and Bob both renames the file at the same time. It creates a conflict. We have a first replication (from Alice to Bob), but nothing happens on B because the local revision (4-4bb) is greater than the candidate revision (4-4aa) and the content is the same. Just after that, we have a revision on the opposite direction (from Bob to Alice). The candidate revision wins (4-4bb), but for files, we don\u2019t use CouchDB conflict, thus it\u2019s not possible to write a new revision at the same generation (4). The only option is to create a new revision (5-5bb). This revision is then sent to Bob: Bob\u2019s Cozy accepts the new revision even if it has no effect on the file (it was already the good name), just to resolve the conflict. Example 2 \u00b6 Like in the last example, Alice uploads a file and share a directory to Bob with this file, Bob acccepts. But then, several actions are made on the file in a short lapse of time and it generates a difficult conflict: Alice renames the file, and then uploads a new version with cozy-desktop Bob moves the file to a sub-directory. So, when the replication comes, we have two versions of the file with different name, parent directory, and content. The winner is the higher revision (4-4aa). The resolution takes 4 steps: A copy of the file is created from the revision 3-3bb, with the new identifier id2 = XorID(id, 3-3bb). The new content is written on Bob\u2019s Cozy: we can\u2019t use the revisions 3-3aa (same generation as 3-3bb) and 4-4aa (it will mean the conflict is fixed, but it\u2019s not the case, the filenames are still different), so a new revision is used (4-4cc). The file is moved and renamed on Bob\u2019s Cozy, with a next revision (5-5bb). The two files are sent to Alice\u2019s Cozy: 5-5bb is accepted just to resolve the conflict, and id2 is uploaded as a new file.

The data is duplicated: it is both on the owner\u2019s cozy, and on the recipients\u2019 cozy (no cloud federation like NextCloud). The applications say what is shared, the stack synchronizes that. The stack does the low-level stuff and gives primitives to the applications. The applications must use them in a responsible manner, and in particular, to avoid transitivity issues. The CouchDB replication will be used to synchronize the documents. It means that the documents will be same on the owner and on the recipients (\u201csymetric sharing\u201d).

First and foremost, they have a binary attached to them that can be quite heavy. The stack also enforces some rules on them (e.g. a file can\u2019t be added to a deleted folder) and has some specific code for the tree nature of files and folders (e.g. a permission on a folder is inherited on all the files and folders inside it, even if they are several levels below). Thus, the workflow explained just before is not compatible with the files. As we need to introduce some code specific to the files, we have also wanted to improve the sharing of files. First, we don\u2019t want to force the recipients to put the shared folder at exactly the same place as the owner. In fact, we think that putting the shared folder in a folder called Shared with me is more friendly. We also think that a file that has been shared in the past but is no longer (the sharing has been revoked) can evolve on both the owner\u2019s cozy and on the recipients\u2019 cozy in different ways, and in such a case, it\u2019s more logical to consider them as different files. These two reasons implies, on a technical level, that the identifiers for files and folders are not the same on the owner and the recipients of a sharing. The replicator will translate the identifiers from one system to another during the replications. Of course, it will also translate the id in the sharing rules, and the dir_id to preserve the relationship between a file and its parent folder. The path attribute will be seen as a cache, and recomputed when a cozy instance receives a folder document from a sharing replication. We will continue to have a replication as close to the CouchDB replication as possible. It means we synchronize a state, and not looking for the history of operations like cozy-desktop does. It is less accurate and can lead more often to conflicts. The cozy instances are expected to be online most of the time and have a short delay for replications: we think that the conflicts will happen only on rares occasions. This make acceptable to take this shortcut. And, in case of conflicts, we will preserve the content of the files (no data loss), even if it means duplicating the files.","title":"Why are they special?"},{"location":"/cozy-stack/sharing-design/#how-a-sharing-involving-files-works","text":"When a sharing involves a rule on the io.cozy.files doctype, a folder is created on the recipients cozy where the files will be put. It is created inside the Shared with me folder by default, but can be moved somewhere else after that. The folder won\u2019t be synchronized its-self later, and if the folder is trashed, the sharing is automatically revoked. As it is not a reversible action, a confirmation is asked before doing that. Note: we will forbid the sharing of the root of the virtual file system, of the trash and trashed files/folders, and of the Shared with me folder. The step 3 described above, aka the replicator, will be more complicated for folders and files. First change, it will work on two phases: 1. what can be synchronized without transfering the binaries first, and 2. the synchronization of files with a binary attached. Second change, the replicator will acquire the Virtual File System lock on the cozy instance where it will write things to ensure the consistency of what it writes. Third change, before inserting a folder or file in the database, the replicator checks that its parent exists, and if it\u2019s not the case, it creates it.

In such a case, we create a copy of the file with one version, while keeping the other version in the original file. For 3., we rename the file or folder with the smaller id . For 4., we restore the trashed parent, or recreate it if it the trash was emptied.","title":"Conflict resolution"},{"location":"/cozy-stack/sharing-design/#conflict-with-no-reconciliation","text":"When a file is modified concurrently on two cozy instances, and at least one change involve the content, we can\u2019t reconciliate the modifications. To know which version of the file is the \u201cwinner\u201d and will keep the same identifier, and which version is the \u201closer\u201d and will have a new identifier, we compare the revisions and the higher wins. This conflict is particulary tricky to resolve, with a lot of subcases. In particular, we try to converge to the same revisions on all the instances for the \u201cwinner\u201d file (and for the \u201closer\u201d too). We have 3 sets of attributes for files: size and md5sum (they change when the content has changed) name and dir_id (they change when the file is moved or renamed) created_at , updated_at , tags , referenced_by , etc. For the first two sets, the operation on the Virtual File System will needs to reach the storage (Swift), not just CouchDB. For the third set, it\u2019s easy: we can do the change at the same time as another change, because these attributes are only used in CouchDB. But we can\u2019t do a change on the first two sets at the same time: the Virtual File System can\u2019t update the content and move/rename a file in the same operation. If we needs to do both, it will generate 2 revisions in CouchDB for the file. Note: you can see that using CouchDB-like replication protocol means that we have some replications that can look useless, just some echo to a writing.

If the user wants to use several account, the Home can setup several triggers for the same konnector & various accounts. Konnector Worker specs \u00b6 Prepare the execution \u00b6 The cozy-stack prepares the execution of the konnector by doing these steps: it checks that the konnector is not in maintenance in the registry (execpt for manual execution) it ensures that the konnector has a folder where it can write its files, and has the permission to write in this folder. Execute the konnector \u00b6 Start the konnector through nsjail, passing as ENV variables : - `COZY_URL`: the starting instance URL - `COZY_CREDENTIALS`: security token to communicate with Cozy - `COZY_FIELDS`: JSON-encoded message with the arguments from the trigger - `COZY_PARAMETERS`: JSON-encoded parameters from the konnector manifest - `COZY_LANGUAGE`: the language field of the konnector (eg. \"node\" etc.) - `COZY_LOCALE`: the locale of the user (eg. \"en\" etc.) - `COZY_TIME_LIMIT`: how much time the konnector can run before being killed - `COZY_JOB_ID`: id of the job - `COZY_JOB_MANUAL_EXECUTION`: whether the job was started manually (in Home) or automatically (via a cron trigger or event) The konnector process can send events trough its stdout (newline separated JSON object), the konnector worker pass these events to the realtime hub as io.cozy.jobs.events . Only JSON formatted events are forwarded to the client-side throught realtime Otherwise formatted lines (such as node Error) will be kept in some system logs. Konnectors should NOT log the received account login values in production. Konnector error handling \u00b6 The konnector can output json formated messages as stated before (the events) and those events will be typed and formatted like this: { type : \"messagetype\" , // can be \"debug\", \"info\", \"warning\", \"error\", and \"critical\" message : \"message\" // can be any string } If there is an error or critical message, the execution will be seen as a failure by cozy-stack. It\u2019s also the case if the konnector reaches the timeout or returns with a non-zero status code. Note: debug and info level are not transmitted to syslog, except if the instance is in debug mode. It would be too verbose to do otherwise. Account deleted \u00b6 When an account is deleted, or a konnector is going to be uninstalled, the konnector is executed with the account_deleted field to true, so it can clean the account remotely. OAuth (and service secrets) \u00b6 Doctypes \u00b6 io.cozy.konnectors gives their desiderata for an account { \"fields\" : { \"account\" : { \"doctype\" : \"io.cozy.accounts\" , \"account_type\" : \"maif\" , \"scope\" : \"openid profile offline_access\" } } } io.cozy.accounts contains authentication information for an account, as well as the associated scope { \"name\" : \"Mon Compte Maif\" , \"account_type\" : \"maif\" , \"status\" : \"connected\" , \"oauth\" : { \"access_token\" : \"akosaksoakso\" , \"refresh_token\" : \"okoakozkaozk\" , \"scope\" : \"openid profile offline_access\" } } io.cozy.account_types contains the oauth configuration: { \"_id\" : \"service.example\" , \"grant_mode\" : \"authorization_code\" , \"client_id\" : \"the registered client id\" , \"client_secret\" : \"client_secret is necessary for server-flow\" , \"auth_endpoint\" : \"https://service.example/auth\" , \"token_endpoint\" : \"https://api.service.example/token\" } io.cozy.account_types are not accessible to the applications: they are injected directly in CouchDB in a global database secrets/io-cozy-accounts_type . Secrets that are not OAuth \u00b6 The io.cozy.account_types doctype can also be used for storing secrets that are not related to OAuth. The document still need to be injected manually in secrets/io-cozy-accounts_type : { \"_id\": \"service.example\", \"grant_mode\": \"secret\", \"slug\": \"service\", \"secret\": \"th1$_1$_th3_s3cr3t!\" } Note : grant_mode must be secret , slug must be the slug of the konnector, but secret can be a map instead of a simple string if several secrets are needed for this service. The secret is given to the konnector in the COZY_PARAMETERS env variable. Reminder OAuth flow \u00b6 Service is the website from which konnector aims to retrieve informations. Stack is the cozy stack. OAuth is divided in 3 steps: Client Registration: the client application (the Stack) needs to be registered with the Service Obtaining & Refreshing Authorization: all the steps from client_id to access_token , the Stack will handle those Using the access_token : ideally, the konnector should only concern itself with this part; it receives an access_token and uses it. Client Registration \u00b6 Before beginning the Grant process, most Services require the application to be registered with a defined redirect_uri . There are a lot of options, which we will choose from when actually implementing konnectors using them. Manually \u00b6 Most services requires a human developer to create the client manually and define its redirect_uri. However each instance has its own domain, so for these services, we will need to: A. Register a \u201cproxy\u201d client , which is a static page performing redirections as needed, as was done for Facebook events in v2 konnectors. We will register a well known cozy domain, like oauth-proxy.cozy.io and registers it with all providers. The use and risks associated with this domain should be made clear to the user. B. Register each Stack with a redirect_uri on the main stack domain, if we go this way, the register_uri below moves from bob.cozy.rocks/accounts/redirect to oauthcallback.cozy.rocks/redirect and the domain will be prepended to the state. This is feasible at cozy scale, but requires more knowledge and work for self-hosters. Example: Google \u00b6 For example, these are the steps for creating the google account_type for the stack at .mycozy.cloud: Go to https://console.developers.google.com Select or Create Project (up left near the logo) Enable desired APIs (TBD with usages) Click \u201cCredentials\u201d Create credentials > Oauth Client ID > Web application Set redirectURI to https://oauthcallback.mycozy.cloud/accounts/google/redirect Copy and paste provided Client ID and Client Secret. Then save the data in the console http PUT localhost:5984/secrets%2Fio-cozy-account_types/google grant_mode=authorization_code redirect_uri=\"https://oauthcallback.mycozy.cloud/accounts/google/redirect\" token_mode=basic token_endpoint=\"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token\" auth_endpoint=\"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth\" client_id=$CLIENT_ID client_secret=$CLIENT_SECRET Dynamic Registration Protocol \u00b6 A few services allows client to register programaticaly through the Dynamic Client Registration Protocol RFC7591 , we should allow the Stack to register using this protocol when we first need to implement a Konnector connecting to such a Service. No redirect_url enforcement \u00b6 A few services allows to specify arbitrary redirect_url without registering beforehand as a client. Authorization Grant flows \u00b6 webserver flow (Authorization Code Grant) \u00b6 A. In the cozy app (Home) give a link < a href = \"https://bob.cozy.rocks/accounts/service-name/start? scope=photos& state=1234zyx\" > NOTE the scope may depends on other fields being configured (checkboxes), this will be described in json in the konnectors manifest. The format will be determined upon implementation. NOTE To limit bandwidth and risk of state corruption, the cozy app should save its state under a random key into localStorage, the key is then passed as the state in this query. B. Service lets the user login, allows or denies the scope, then redirects to https://oauthcallback.cozy.rocks/accounts/service-name/redirect? code=AUTH_CODE_HERE& state=1234zyx C. The Stack does Server side this request: POST https://api.service.example/oauth/access_token HTTP / 1.1 Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded grant_type=authorization_code& code=AUTH_CODE_HERE& redirect_uri=https://oauthcallback.cozy.rocks/accounts/service-name/redirect& client_id=CLIENT_ID& client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET D. The Service responds (server side) with: { \"access_token\" : \"ACCESS_TOKEN\" , \"token_type\" : \"bearer\" , \"expires_in\" : 2592000 , \"refresh_token\" : \"REFRESH_TOKEN\" , \"scope\" : \"read\" , \"uid\" : 100101 , \"info\" : { \"name\" : \"Claude Douillet\" , \"email\" : \"claude.douillet@example.com\" } } This whole object is saved as-is into a io.cozy.accounts \u2018s extras field. The known fields access_token , refresh_token & scope will be also saved on the account\u2019s oauth itself E. The Stack redirect the user to the cozy app: HTTP / 1.1 302 Found Location : https://bob-home.cozy.rocks/?state=1234zyx&account=accountID The Cozy app checks that the state is expected, and restores its state to the form but whith account completed. SPA flow (Implicit grant) \u00b6 A. The cozy app gives a link: < a href = \"https://service.example/auth? (url) response_type=token& client_id=CLIENT_ID& redirect_uri=https://bob-home.cozy.rocks/& scope=photos& state=1234zyx\" > See server-flow for state rules. B. Service lets the user login, allows or denies the scope, then redirects to https://bob-home.cozy.rocks/? access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN& state=1234zyx C. The Cozy app adds the token to the io.cozy.accounts and save it before starting konnector. Accessing data \u00b6 Once we have an account, the Cozy app starts the konnector with the proper account id. The konnector can then fetch the account and use its access_token to performs a request to fetch data: POST https://api.service.com/resource HTTP / 1.1 Authorization : Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN Refreshing token \u00b6 When using the server-flow, we also get a refresh_token. It is used to get a new access_token when it expires. However, if konnectors are responsible for refreshing token there is a race condition risk : (konnector A) GET https://api.service.com/resource TOKEN1 -> expired (konnector B) GET https://api.service.com/resource TOKEN1 -> expired (konnector A) POST https://api.service.com/token REFRESH_TOKEN -> TOKEN2a (konnector B) POST https://api.service.com/token REFRESH_TOKEN -> TOKEN2b (konnector A) GET https://api.service.com/token TOKEN2a -> invalid To avoid this, the stack will be responsible to perform token refresh. A konnector can requires the stack to refresh an account token with an HTTP request. POST https://bob.cozy.rocks/accounts/:accountID/refresh HTTP / 1.1 Konnectors Marketplace Requirements \u00b6 The following is a few points to be careful for in konnectors when we start allowing non-cozy developped OAuth konnectors. With SPA flow, because of advanced security concerns (confused deputy problem), cozy should validate the access_token . However, the way to do that depends on the provider and cannot be described in json, it is therefore the responsibility of the konnector itself. Account types security rules \u00b6 With server flow, an evil account type with proper auth_endpoint but bad token_endpoint could retrieve a valid token as well as cozy client secret. The reviewer of an account_type should make sure both these endpoints are on domains belonging to the Service provider. Notes for MesInfos experiment \u00b6 MAIF konnector uses the webserver flow without redirect_uri validation Orange konnector uses the client-side proxy but hosted on their own servers (/!\\ redirect_uri vs redirect_url)","title":"Workflow of the konnectors"},{"location":"/cozy-stack/konnectors-workflow/#konnectors-workflow","text":"","title":"Konnectors workflow"},{"location":"/cozy-stack/konnectors-workflow/#tldr","text":"","title":"TL;DR"},{"location":"/cozy-stack/konnectors-workflow/#types","text":"","title":"Types"},{"location":"/cozy-stack/konnectors-workflow/#accounts","text":"io.cozy.accounts contains information for an account, including those for authentication (technically, they are encrypted by cozy-stack before being saved in CouchDB, but we will show them as the konnectors will see them): { \"auth\" : { \"login\" : \"000000000\" , \"password\" : \"**********\" }, \"folderPath\" : \"/Administratif/Free Mobile\" , \"label\" : \"freemobile\" , \"namePath\" : \"Free Mobile\" } Accounts are manipulated through the /data/ API.","title":"Accounts"},{"location":"/cozy-stack/konnectors-workflow/#aggregator-accounts","text":"Some konnectors are based on an aggregator service.

When the cozy-stack receives a request, it checks that the request is authorized, and if yes, it processes it and answers it. What about OAuth2? \u00b6 OAuth2 is about delegating an access to resources on a server to another party. It is a framework, not a strictly defined protocol, for organizing the interactions between these 4 actors: the resource owner, the \u201cuser\u201d that can click on buttons the client, the website or application that would like to access the resources the authorization server, whose role is limited to give tokens but is central in OAuth2 interactions the resources server, the server that controls the resources. For cozy, both the authorization server and the resources server roles are played by the cozy-stack. The resource owner is the owner of a cozy instance. The client can be the cozy-desktop app, cozy-mobile, or many other applications. OAuth2, and its extensions, is a large world. At its core, there is 2 things: letting the client get a token issued by the authorization server, and using this token to access to the resources. OAuth2 describe 4 flows, called grant types, for the first part: Authorization code Implicit grant type Client credentials grant type Resource owner credentials grant type. On cozy, only the most typical one is used: authorization code. To start this flow, the client must have a client_id and client_secret . The Cozy stack implements the OAuth2 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol (an extension to OAuth2) to allow the clients to obtain them. OAuth2 has also 3 ways to use a token: in the query-string (even if the spec does not recommended it) in the POST body in the HTTP Authorization header. On cozy, only the HTTP header is supported. OAuth2 has a lot of assumptions. Let\u2019s see some of them and their consequences on Cozy: TLS is very important to secure the communications. in OAuth 1, there was a mechanism to sign the requests. But it was very difficult to get it right for the developers and was abandonned in OAuth2, in favor of using TLS. The Cozy instance are already accessible only in HTTPS, so there is nothing particular to do for that. There is a principle called TOFU, Trust On First Use. It said that if the user will give his permission for delegating access to its resources when the client will try to access them for the first time. Later, the client will be able to keep accessing them even if the user is no longer here to give his permissions. The client can\u2019t make the assumptions about when its tokens will work. The tokens have no meaning for him (like cookies in a browser), they are just something it got from the authorization server and can send with its request. The access token can expire, the user can revoke them, etc. OAuth 2.0 defines no cryptographic methods. But a developer that want to use it will have to put her hands in that. If you want to learn OAuth 2 in details, I recommend the OAuth 2 in Action book . The cozy stack as an authorization server \u00b6 In general, the cozy stack manages the authentication itself. This is what is described below. In some special cases, an integration with other softwares can be mandatory: this is possible to configure via delegated authentication . GET /auth/login \u00b6 Display a form with a password field to let the user authenticates herself to the cozy stack. This endpoint accepts a redirect parameter. If the user is already logged in, she will be redirected immediately. Else, the parameter will be transfered in the POST. This parameter can only contain a link to an application installed on the cozy (thus to a subdomain of the cozy instance). To protect against stealing authorization code with redirection, the fragment is always overriden: GET /auth/login?redirect=https://contacts.cozy.example.org/foo?bar#baz HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Cookie : ... Note : the redirect parameter should be URL-encoded. We haven\u2019t done that to make it clear what the path ( foo ), the query-string ( bar ), and the fragment ( baz ) are. HTTP / 1.1 302 Moved Temporarily Location : https://contacts.cozy.example.org/foo?bar# If the redirect parameter is invalid, the response will be 400 Bad Request . Same for other parameters, the redirection will happen only on success (even if OAuth2 says the authorization server can redirect on errors, it\u2019s very complicated to do it safely, and it is better to avoid this trap). POST /auth/login \u00b6 After the user has typed her passphrase and clicked on Login , a request is made to this endpoint. The redirect parameter is passed inside the body. If it is missing, the redirection will be made against the default target: the home application of this cozy instance. POST /auth/login HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded passphrase=p4ssw0rd&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fcontacts.cozy.example.org HTTP / 1.1 302 Moved Temporarily Set-Cookie : ... Location : https://contacts.cozy.example.org/foo When two-factor authentication (2FA) authentication is activated, this endpoint will not directly sent a redirection after this first passphrase step. In such case, a 200 OK response is sent along with a token value in the response (either in JSON if requested or directly in a new HTML form). Along with this token, on 2FA passcode is sent to the user via another transport (email for instance, depending on the user\u2019s preferences). Another request should be sent to the same endpoint with a valid pair (token, passcode) , ensuring that the user correctly entered its passphrase and received a fresh passcode by another mean. POST /auth/login HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded two-factor-token=123123123123&passcode=678678&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fcontacts.cozy.example.org HTTP / 1.1 302 Moved Temporarily Set-Cookie : ... Location : https://contacts.cozy.example.org/foo DELETE /auth/login \u00b6 This can be used to log-out the user. An app token must be passed in the Authorization header, to protect against CSRF attack on this (this can part of bigger attacks like session fixation). DELETE /auth/login HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Cookie : seesioncookie.... Authorization : Bearer app-token DELETE /auth/login/others \u00b6 This can be used to log-out all active sessions except the one used by the request. This allow to disconnect any other users currenctly authenticated on the system. An app token must be passed in the Authorization header, to protect against CSRF attack on this (this can part of bigger attacks like session fixation). DELETE /auth/login/others HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Cookie : seesioncookie.... Authorization : Bearer app-token GET /auth/passphrase_reset \u00b6 Display a form for the user to reset its password, in case he has forgotten it for example. If the user is connected, he won\u2019t be shown this form and he will be directly redirected to his cozy. GET /auth/passphrase_reset HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Content-Type : text/html Cookie : ... POST /auth/passphrase_reset \u00b6 After the user has clicked on the reset button of the passphrase reset form, it will execute a request to this endpoint. This endpoint will create a token for the user to actually renew his passphrase. The token has a short-live duration of about 15 minutes. After the token is created, it is sent to the user on its mailbox. This endpoint will redirect the user on the login form page. POST /auth/passphrase_reset HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded csrf_token=123456890 GET /auth/passphrase_renew \u00b6 Display a form for the user to enter a new password. This endpoint should be used with a token query parameter. This token makes sure that the user has actually reset its passphrase and should have been sent via its mailbox. GET /auth/passphrase_renew?token=123456789 HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Content-Type : text/html Cookie : ... POST /auth/passphrase_renew \u00b6 After the user has entered its new passphrase in the renew passphrase form, a request is made to this endpoint to renew the passphrase. This endpoint requires a valid token to actually work. In case of a success, the user is redirected to the login form. POST /auth/passphrase_reset HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded csrf_token=123456890&passphrase_reset_token=123456789&passphrase=mynewpassphrase GET /auth/passphrase \u00b6 This page renders a form to set the password for an onboarding instance. This endpoint expects a valid registerToken parameter. In case of success, the instance is marked as onboarded and the user is redirected to his home. If the instance is already onboarded, the user is redirected to his home. GET /auth/passphrase/?registerToken=e0fbe2c5b90cdcdd9b3487b48b480e0b HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Content-Type : text/html POST /auth/register \u00b6 This route is used by OAuth2 clients to dynamically register them-selves. See OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol for the details. The client must send a JSON request, with at least: redirect_uris , an array of strings with the redirect URIs that the client will use in the authorization flow client_name , human-readable string name of the client to be presented to the end-user during authorization software_id , an identifier of the software used by the client (it should remain the same for all instances of the client software, whereas client_id varies between instances). It can also send the optional fields: client_kind (possible values: web, desktop, mobile, browser, etc.) client_uri , URL string of a web page providing information about the client logo_uri , to display an icon to the user in the authorization flow policy_uri , URL string that points to a human-readable privacy policy document that describes how the deployment organization collects, uses, retains, and discloses personal data software_version , a version identifier string for the client software. notification_platform , to activate notifications on the associated device, this field specify the platform used to send notifications: \"android\" : for Android devices with notifications via Firebase Cloud Messageing \"ios\" : for iOS devices with notifications via APNS/2. notification_device_token , the token used to identify the mobile device for notifications The server gives to the client the previous fields and these informations: client_id client_secret registration_access_token Example: POST /auth/register HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Content-Type : application/json Accept : application/json { \"redirect_uris\" : [ \"https://client.example.org/oauth/callback\" ], \"client_name\" : \"Client\" , \"software_id\" : \"github.com/example/client\" , \"software_version\" : \"2.0.1\" , \"client_kind\" : \"web\" , \"client_uri\" : \"https://client.example.org/\" , \"logo_uri\" : \"https://client.example.org/logo.svg\" , \"policy_uri\" : \"https://client/example.org/policy\" } HTTP / 1.1 201 Created Content-Type : application/json { \"client_id\" : \"64ce5cb0-bd4c-11e6-880e-b3b7dfda89d3\" , \"client_secret\" : \"eyJpc3Mi[...omitted for brevity...]\" , \"client_secret_expires_at\" : 0 , \"registration_access_token\" : \"J9l-ZhwP[...omitted for brevity...]\" , \"grant_types\" : [ \"authorization_code\" , \"refresh_token\" ], \"response_types\" : [ \"code\" ], \"redirect_uris\" : [ \"https://client.example.org/oauth/callback\" ], \"client_name\" : \"Client\" , \"software_id\" : \"github.com/example/client\" , \"software_version\" : \"2.0.1\" , \"client_kind\" : \"web\" , \"client_uri\" : \"https://client.example.org/\" , \"logo_uri\" : \"https://client.example.org/logo.svg\" , \"policy_uri\" : \"https://client/example.org/policy\" } Linked applications \u00b6 Some OAuth applications are a mobile or desktop version of a Cozy webapp. For them, it\u2019s possible to use a special software_id to make a link between the mobile/desktop application and the webapp. The software_id must be in a registry://slug format, like registry://drive for Cozy-Drive for example. When it is the case, the mobile/desktop will share its permissions with the webapp. It means several things: The mobile/desktop app will have the same permissions that the linked webapp. When a sharing by link is done in the mobile/desktop application, the linked webapp will be able to revoke it later, and vice versa. When the user accepts to give access to its Cozy to the mobile/desktop app, the linked webapp will be installed on the Cozy if it was not already the case. When the linked webapp is uninstalled, the right to access the Cozy for the mobile/desktop app will be revoked. GET /auth/register/:client-id \u00b6 This route is used by the clients to get informations about them-selves. The client has to send its registration access token to be able to use this endpoint. See OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Management Protocol for more details.

The client has to send its registration access token to be able to use this endpoint. Note: the client can ask to change its client_secret . To do that, it must send the current client_secret , and the server will respond with the new client_secret .

HTTP / 1.1 204 No Content Content-Type : application/json GET /auth/authorize \u00b6 When an OAuth2 client wants to get access to the data of the cozy owner, it starts the OAuth2 dance with this step. The user is shown what the client asks and has an accept button if she is OK with that. The parameters are: client_id , that identify the client redirect_uri , it has to be exactly the same as the one used in registration state , it\u2019s a protection against CSRF on the client (a random string generated by the client, that it can check when the user will be redirected with the authorization code. It can be used as a key in local storage for storing a state in a SPA). response_type , only code is supported scope , a space separated list of the permissions asked (like io.cozy.files:GET for read-only access to files). GET /auth/authorize?client_id=oauth-client-1&response_type=code&scope=io.cozy.files:GET%20io.cozy.contacts&state=Eh6ahshepei5Oojo&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.org%2F HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Note we warn the user that he is about to share his data with an application which only the callback URI is guaranteed. POST /auth/authorize \u00b6 When the user accepts, her browser send a request to this endpoint: POST /auth/authorize HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded state=Eh6ahshepei5Oojo&client_id=oauth-client-1&scope=io.cozy.files:GET%20io.cozy.contacts&csrf_token=johw6Sho&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.org%2F Note : this endpoint is protected against CSRF attacks. The user is then redirected to the original client, with an access code in the URL: HTTP / 1.1 302 Moved Temporarily Location : https://client.org/?state=Eh6ahshepei5Oojo&code=Aih7ohth# GET /auth/authorize/sharing & POST /auth/authorize/sharing \u00b6 They are similar to /auth/authorize : they also make the user accept an OAuth thing, but it is specialized for sharing. They are a few differences, like the scope format (sharing rules, not permissions) and the redirection after the POST. POST /auth/access_token \u00b6 Now, the client can check that the state is correct, and if it is the case, ask for an access_token . It can use this route with the code given above. This endpoint is also used to refresh the access token, by sending the refresh_token instead of the code . The parameters are: grant_type , with authorization_code or refresh_token as value code or refresh_token , depending on which grant type is used client_id client_secret Example: POST /auth/access_token HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded Accept : application/json grant_type=authorization_code&code=Aih7ohth&client_id=oauth-client-1&client_secret=Oung7oi5 HTTP / 1.1 200 OK Content-type : application/json { \"access_token\" : \"ooch1Yei\" , \"token_type\" : \"bearer\" , \"refresh_token\" : \"ui0Ohch8\" , \"scope\" : \"io.cozy.files:GET io.cozy.contacts\" } POST /auth/secret_exchange \u00b6 This endpoint is designed to trade a secret for a client. It is useful when an OAuth client had been previously generated by an external entity with an onboarding secret. The only parameter needed is secret . POST /auth/secret_exchange HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Accept : application/json Content-Type : application/json { \"secret\" : \"myS3Cr3t!\" } HTTP / 1.1 200 OK Content-type : application/json { \"client_id\" : \"cf60f07cd7e00d0c0f86cd3f29240477\" , \"client_secret\" : \"NNSLTid18EATInQWyg2XGKd_vs0e3zUC\" , \"client_secret_expires_at\" : 0 , \"redirect_uris\" : [ \"https://example.org/oauth/callback\" ], \"grant_types\" : [ \"authorization_code\" , \"refresh_token\" ], \"response_types\" : [ \"code\" ], \"client_name\" : \"cozy-test-3\" , \"software_id\" : \"github.com/cozy/cozy-test\" , \"notifications\" : null , \"onboarding_secret\" : \"myS3Cr3t!\" } FAQ \u00b6 What format is used for tokens? The access tokens are formatted as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) , like this: Claim Fullname What it identifies aud Audience Identify the recipient where the token can be used (like access ) iss Issuer Identify the Cozy instance (its domain in fact) iat Issued At Identify when the token was issued (Unix timestamp) sub Subject Identify the client that can use the token scope Scope Identify the scope of actions that the client can accomplish The scope is used for permissions . Other tokens can be JWT with a similar formalism, or be a simple random value (when we want to have a clear revocation process). What happens when the user has lost her passphrase? She can reset it from the command-line, like this: $ cozy-stack instances reset-passphrase cozy.example.org ek0Jah1R A new password is generated and print in the console. Is two-factor authentication (2FA) possible? Yes, it\u2019s possible. Via the cozy-settings application, the two-factor authentication can be activated. Here is how it works in more details: On each connection, when the 2FA is activated, the user is asked for its passphrase first. When entering correct passphrase, the user is then asked for: a TOTP (Timebased One-Time password, RFC 6238) derived from a secret associated with the instance. a short term timestamped MAC with the same validity time-range and also derived from the same secret. The TOTP is valid for a time range of about 5 minutes. When sending a correct and still-valid pair (passcode, token) , the user is granted with authentication cookie. The passcode can be sent to the instance\u2019s owner via email \u2014 more transport shall be added later. Client-side apps \u00b6 Important : OAuth2 is not used here! The steps looks similar (like obtaining a token), but when going in the details, it doesn\u2019t match. How to register the application? \u00b6 The application is registered at install. See app management for details. How to get a token? \u00b6 When a user access an application, she first loads the HTML page. Inside this page, a token specific to this app is injected (only for private routes), via a templating method. We have prefered our custom solution to the implicit grant type of OAuth2 for 2 reasons: It has a better User Experience. The implicit grant type works with 2 redirections (the application to the stack, and then the stack to the application), and the first one needs JS to detect if the token is present or not in the fragment hash. It has a strong impact on the time to load the application. The implicit grant type of OAuth2 has a severe drawback on security: the token appears in the URL and is shown by the browser. It can also be leaked with the HTTP Referer header. The token will be given only for the authenticated user. For nested subdomains (like calendar.joe.example.net ), the session cookie from the stack is enough (it is for .joe.example.net ). But for flat subdomains (like joe-calendar.example.net ), it\u2019s more complicated. On the first try of the user, she will be redirected to the stack. As she is already logged-in, she will be redirected to the app with a session code (else she can login). This session code can be exchanged to a session cookie. A redirection will still happen to remove the code from the URL (it helps to avoid the code being saved in the browser history). For security reasons, the session code have the following properties: It can only be used once. It is tied to an application ( calendar in our example). It has a very short time span of validity (1 minute). How to use a token? \u00b6 The token can be sent to the cozy-stack as a Bearer token in the Authorization header, like this: GET /data/io.cozy.events/6494e0ac-dfcb-11e5-88c1-472e84a9cbee HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Authorization : Bearer application-token If the user is authenticated, her cookies will be sent automatically. The cookies are needed for a token to be valid. How to refresh a token? \u00b6 The token is valid only for 24 hours. If the application is opened for more than that, it will need to get a new token. But most applications won\u2019t be kept open for so long and it\u2019s okay if they don\u2019t try to refresh tokens. At worst, the user just had to reload its page and it will work again. The app can know it\u2019s time to get a new token when the stack starts sending 401 Unauthorized responses. In that case, it can fetches the same html page that it was loaded initially, parses it and extracts the new token. Third-party websites \u00b6 How to register the application? \u00b6 If a third-party websites would like to access a cozy, it had to register first. For example, a big company can have data about a user and may want to offer her a way to get her data back in her cozy. When the user is connected on the website of this company, she can give her cozy address. The website will then register on this cozy, using the OAuth2 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol, as explained above . How to get a token? \u00b6 To get an access token, it\u2019s enough to follow the authorization code flow of OAuth2: sending the user to the cozy, on the authorize page if the user approves, she is then redirected back to the client the client gets the access code and can exchange it to an access token. How to use a token? \u00b6 The access token can be sent as a bearer token, in the Authorization header of HTTP: GET /data/io.cozy.contacts/6494e0ac-dfcb-11e5-88c1-472e84a9cbee HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Accept : application/json Authorization : Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWV9.TJVA95OrM7E2cBab30RMHrHDcEfxjoYZgeFONFh7HgQ How to refresh a token? \u00b6 The access token will be valid only for 24 hours. After that, a new access token must be asked. To do that, just follow the refresh token flow, as explained above . Devices and browser extensions \u00b6 For devices and browser extensions, it is nearly the same than for third-party websites. The main difficulty is the redirect_uri. In OAuth2, the access code is given to the client by redirecting the user to an URL controlled by the client. But devices and browser extensions don\u2019t have an obvious URL for that. The IETF has published an RFC called OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps . Native apps on desktop \u00b6 A desktop native application can start an embedded webserver on localhost. The redirect_uri will be something like http://127.0.0.1:19856/callback . Native apps on mobile \u00b6 On mobile, the native apps can often register a custom URI scheme, like com.example.oauthclient:/ . Just be sure that no other app has registered itself with the same URI. Chrome extensions \u00b6 Chrome extensions can use URL like https://<extension-id>.chromiumapp.org/<anything-here> for their usage. See https://developer.chrome.com/apps/app_identity#non for more details. It has also a method to simplify the creation of such an URL: chrome.identity.getRedirectURL . Firefox extensions \u00b6 It is possible to use an out of band URN: urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob:auto . The token is then extracted from the title of the page. See this addon for google oauth2 as an example. Security considerations \u00b6 The password will be stored in a secure fashion, with a password hashing function. The hashing function and its parameter will be stored with the hash, in order to make it possible to change the algorithm and/or the parameters later if we had any suspicion that it became too weak. The initial algorithm is scrypt . The access code is valid only once, and will expire after 5 minutes Dynamically registered applications won\u2019t have access to all possible scopes. For example, an application that has been dynamically registered can\u2019t ask the cozy owner to give it the right to install other applications. This limitation should improve security, as avoiding too powerful scopes to be used with unknown applications. The cozy stack will apply rate limiting to avoid brute-force attacks. The cozy stack offers CORS for most of its services. But it\u2019s disabled for /auth (it doesn\u2019t make sense here) and for the client-side applications (to avoid leaking their tokens). The client should really use HTTPS for its redirect_uri parameter, but it\u2019s allowed to use HTTP for localhost, as in the native desktop app example. OAuth2 says that the state parameter is optional in the authorization code flow. But it is mandatory to use it with Cozy. For more on this subject, here is a list of links: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#page-53 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819 https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-closing-redirectors-00 http://www.oauthsecurity.com/ Conclusion \u00b6 Security is hard.

When the cozy-stack receives a request, it checks that the request is authorized, and if yes, it processes it and answers it.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"/cozy-stack/auth/#what-about-oauth2","text":"OAuth2 is about delegating an access to resources on a server to another party. It is a framework, not a strictly defined protocol, for organizing the interactions between these 4 actors: the resource owner, the \u201cuser\u201d that can click on buttons the client, the website or application that would like to access the resources the authorization server, whose role is limited to give tokens but is central in OAuth2 interactions the resources server, the server that controls the resources. For cozy, both the authorization server and the resources server roles are played by the cozy-stack. The resource owner is the owner of a cozy instance. The client can be the cozy-desktop app, cozy-mobile, or many other applications. OAuth2, and its extensions, is a large world. At its core, there is 2 things: letting the client get a token issued by the authorization server, and using this token to access to the resources. OAuth2 describe 4 flows, called grant types, for the first part: Authorization code Implicit grant type Client credentials grant type Resource owner credentials grant type. On cozy, only the most typical one is used: authorization code. To start this flow, the client must have a client_id and client_secret . The Cozy stack implements the OAuth2 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol (an extension to OAuth2) to allow the clients to obtain them. OAuth2 has also 3 ways to use a token: in the query-string (even if the spec does not recommended it) in the POST body in the HTTP Authorization header. On cozy, only the HTTP header is supported. OAuth2 has a lot of assumptions. Let\u2019s see some of them and their consequences on Cozy: TLS is very important to secure the communications. in OAuth 1, there was a mechanism to sign the requests. But it was very difficult to get it right for the developers and was abandonned in OAuth2, in favor of using TLS. The Cozy instance are already accessible only in HTTPS, so there is nothing particular to do for that. There is a principle called TOFU, Trust On First Use. It said that if the user will give his permission for delegating access to its resources when the client will try to access them for the first time. Later, the client will be able to keep accessing them even if the user is no longer here to give his permissions. The client can\u2019t make the assumptions about when its tokens will work. The tokens have no meaning for him (like cookies in a browser), they are just something it got from the authorization server and can send with its request. The access token can expire, the user can revoke them, etc. OAuth 2.0 defines no cryptographic methods. But a developer that want to use it will have to put her hands in that. If you want to learn OAuth 2 in details, I recommend the OAuth 2 in Action book .","title":"What about OAuth2?"},{"location":"/cozy-stack/auth/#the-cozy-stack-as-an-authorization-server","text":"In general, the cozy stack manages the authentication itself.

The implicit grant type works with 2 redirections (the application to the stack, and then the stack to the application), and the first one needs JS to detect if the token is present or not in the fragment hash. It has a strong impact on the time to load the application. The implicit grant type of OAuth2 has a severe drawback on security: the token appears in the URL and is shown by the browser.

The stack does the routing and serve the HTML and the assets for the applications. The assets of the applications are installed in the virtual file system. Install an application \u00b6 The manifest \u00b6 To install an application, cozy needs a manifest. It\u2019s a JSON document that describes the application (its name and icon for example), how to install it and what it needs for its usage (the permissions in particular). While we have considered to use the same manifest format as the W3C for PWAs , it didn\u2019t match our expectations. The manifest format for FirefoxOS is a better fit. We took a lot of inspirations from it, starting with the filename for this file: manifest.webapp . Field Description name the name to display on the home name_prefix the prefix to display with the name slug the default slug (it can be changed at install time) editor the editor\u2019s name to display on the cozy-bar of the app icon an icon for the home screenshots an array of path to the screenshots of the application category the category of the application short_description a short description of the application long_description a long description of the application source where the files of the app can be downloaded developer name and url for the developer locales translations of the name and description fields in other locales langs list of languages tags supported by the application version the current version number license the SPDX license identifier platforms a list of type , url values for derivate of the application for other devices intents a list of intents provided by this app (see here for more details) permissions a map of permissions needed by the app (see here for more details) notifications a map of notifications needed by the app (see here for more details) services a map of the services associated with the app (see below for more details) routes a map of routes for the app (see below for more details) Routes \u00b6 A route make the mapping between the requested paths and the files. It can have an index, which is an HTML file, with a token injected on it that identify both the application. This token must be used with the user cookies to use the services of the cozy-stack. By default, a route can be only visited by the authenticated owner of the instance where the app is installed. But a route can be marked as public. In that case, anybody can visit the route. For example, an application can offer an administration interface on /admin , a public page on /public , and shared assets in /assets : { \"/admin\" : { \"folder\" : \"/\" , \"index\" : \"admin.html\" , \"public\" : false }, \"/public\" : { \"folder\" : \"/public\" , \"index\" : \"index.html\" , \"public\" : true }, \"/assets\" : { \"folder\" : \"/assets\" , \"public\" : true } } If an application has no routes in its manifest, the stack will create one route, this default one: { \"/\" : { \"folder\" : \"/\" , \"index\" : \"index.html\" , \"public\" : false } } Note : if you have a public route, it\u2019s probably better to put the app icon in it. So, the cozy-bar can display it for the users that go on the public part of the app. Services \u00b6 Application may require background and offline process to analyse the user\u2019s data and emit some notification or warning even without the user being on the application. These part of the application are called services and can be declared as part of the application in its manifest. In contrast to konnectors , services have the same permissions as the web application and are not intended to collect outside informations but rather analyse the current set of collected information inside the cozy. However they share the same mechanisms as the konnectors to describe how and when they should be executed: via our trigger system. To define a service, first the code needs to be stored with the application content, as single (packaged) javascript files. In the manifest, declare the service and its parameters following this example: { \"services\" : { \"low-budget-notification\" : { \"type\" : \"node\" , \"file\" : \"/services/low-budget-notification.js\" , \"trigger\" : \"@cron 0 0 0 * * *\" } // ... } } The trigger field should follow the available triggers described in the jobs documentation . The file field should specify the service code run and the type field describe the code type (only \"node\" for now). Available fields to the service \u00b6 During the service execution, the stack will give some environment variables to the service if you need to use them. - \"COZY_URL\" # Cozy URL - \"COZY_CREDENTIALS\" # The cozy app related token - \"COZY_LANGUAGE\" # Lang used for the service (ex: node) - \"COZY_LOCALE\" # Locale of the Cozy - \"COZY_TIME_LIMIT\" # Maximum execution time. After this, the job will be killed - \"COZY_JOB_ID\" # Job ID - \"COZY_COUCH_DOC\" # The CouchDB document which triggers the service Notifications \u00b6 For more informations on how te declare notifications in the manifest, see the notifications documentation . Here is an example: { \"notifications\" : { \"account-balance\" : { \"description\" : \"Alert the user when its account balance is negative\" , \"collapsible\" : true , // only interested in the last value of the notification \"multiple\" : true , // require sub-categories for each account \"stateful\" : false , \"default_priority\" : \"high\" , // high priority for this notification \"templates\" : { \"mail\" : \"file:./notifications/account-balance-mail.tpl\" } } } } Resource caching \u00b6 To help caching of applications assets, we detect the presence of a unique identifier in the name of assets: a unique identifier is matched when the file base name contains a long hexadecimal subpart between \u2018.\u2019, of at least 10 characters. For instance app.badf00dbadf00d.js or icon.badbeefbadbeef.1.png . With such a unique identifier, the asset is considered immutable, and a long cache-control is added on corresponding HTTP responses. We recommend the use of bundling tools like webpack which offer the possibility to add such identifier on the building step of the application packages for all assets. Sources \u00b6 Here is the available sources, defined by the scheme of the source URL: registry:// : to install an application from the instance registries git:// or git+ssh:// : to install an application from a git repository http:// or https:// : to install an application from an http server (via a tarball) file:// : to install an application from a local directory (for instance: file:///home/user/code/cozy-app ) The registry scheme expect the following elements: scheme: registry host: the name of the application path: /:channel the channel of the application (see the registry doc) Examples: registry://drive/stable , registry://drive/beta , and registry://drive/dev . For the git scheme, the fragment in the URL can be used to specify which branch to install. For the http and https schemes, the fragment can be used to give the expected sha256sum.

It is useful if there are newer permissions or Terms Of Service and you want to be sure they were read or accepted. If set to false , the update will be blocked and the user will be told that a new app version is available.\\ > Note: PermissionsAcked can be skipped. \\ If an instance is in a context configured with the parameter permissions_skip_verification sets to true , permissions verification will be ignored.

The sub-domain is the slug used when installing the application ( calendar.cozy.example.org if it was installed via a POST on /apps/calendar). On the main domain ( cozy.example.org ), there will be the registration process, the login form, and it will redirect to home.cozy.example.org for logged-in users. Rationale \u00b6 The applications have different roles and permissions. An application is identified when talking to the stack via a token. The token has to be injected in the application, one way or another, and it have to be unaccessible from other apps. If the applications run on the same domain (for example https://cozy.example.org/apps/calendar ), it\u2019s nearly impossible to protect an application to take the token of another application. The security model of the web is based too heavily on Same Origin Policy for that. If the token is put in the html of the index.html page of an app, another app can use the fetch API to get the html page, parse its content and extract the token. We can think of other ways to inject the token (indexeddb, URL, cookies) but none will provide a better isolation. Maybe in a couple years, when the origin spec will be more advanced. So, if having the apps on the same origin is not possible, we have to put them on several origins. One interesting way to do that is using sandboxed iframes. An iframe with the sandbox attribute , and not allow-same-origin in it, will be assigned to a unique origin. The W3C warns: Potentially hostile files should not be served from the same server as the file containing the iframe element. Sandboxing hostile content is of minimal help if an attacker can convince the user to just visit the hostile content directly, rather than in the iframe. To limit the damage that can be caused by hostile HTML content, it should be served from a separate dedicated domain. Using a different domain ensures that scripts in the files are unable to attack the site, even if the user is tricked into visiting those pages directly, without the protection of the sandbox attribute. It may be possible to disable all html pages to have an html content-type, except the home, and having the home loading the apps in a sandboxed iframe, via the srcdoc attribute. But, it will mean that we will have to reinvent nearly everything. Even showing an image can no longer be done via an <img> tag, it will need to use post-message with the home. Such a solution is difficult to implement, is a very fragile (both for the apps developer than for security) and is an hell to debug when it breaks. Clearly, it\u2019s not an acceptable solution. Thus, the only choice is to have several origins, and sub-domains is the best way for that. Of course, it has the downside to be more complicated to deploy (DNS and TLS certificates). But, in the tradeoff between security and ease of administration, we definetively take the security first. Routes \u00b6 Should we be concerned that all the routes are on the same sub-domain? No, it\u2019s not an issue. There are two types of routes: the ones that are publics and those reserved to the authenticated user. Public routes have no token Private routes are private, they can be accessed only with a valid session cookie, ie by the owner of the instance. Another application can\u2019t use the user cookies to read the token, because of the restrictions of the same origin policy (they are on different domains). And the application can\u2019t use an open proxy to read the private route, because it doesn\u2019t have the user cookies for that (the cookie is marked as httpOnly ).","title":"/apps - Applications Management"},{"location":"/cozy-stack/apps/#applications","text":"It\u2019s possible to manage serverless applications from the cozy stack and serve them via cozy stack.

For example, an application can offer an administration interface on /admin , a public page on /public , and shared assets in /assets : { \"/admin\" : { \"folder\" : \"/\" , \"index\" : \"admin.html\" , \"public\" : false }, \"/public\" : { \"folder\" : \"/public\" , \"index\" : \"index.html\" , \"public\" : true }, \"/assets\" : { \"folder\" : \"/assets\" , \"public\" : true } } If an application has no routes in its manifest, the stack will create one route, this default one: { \"/\" : { \"folder\" : \"/\" , \"index\" : \"index.html\" , \"public\" : false } } Note : if you have a public route, it\u2019s probably better to put the app icon in it.

An application is identified when talking to the stack via a token. The token has to be injected in the application, one way or another, and it have to be unaccessible from other apps. If the applications run on the same domain (for example https://cozy.example.org/apps/calendar ), it\u2019s nearly impossible to protect an application to take the token of another application. The security model of the web is based too heavily on Same Origin Policy for that. If the token is put in the html of the index.html page of an app, another app can use the fetch API to get the html page, parse its content and extract the token. We can think of other ways to inject the token (indexeddb, URL, cookies) but none will provide a better isolation. Maybe in a couple years, when the origin spec will be more advanced. So, if having the apps on the same origin is not possible, we have to put them on several origins. One interesting way to do that is using sandboxed iframes. An iframe with the sandbox attribute , and not allow-same-origin in it, will be assigned to a unique origin. The W3C warns: Potentially hostile files should not be served from the same server as the file containing the iframe element. Sandboxing hostile content is of minimal help if an attacker can convince the user to just visit the hostile content directly, rather than in the iframe. To limit the damage that can be caused by hostile HTML content, it should be served from a separate dedicated domain. Using a different domain ensures that scripts in the files are unable to attack the site, even if the user is tricked into visiting those pages directly, without the protection of the sandbox attribute. It may be possible to disable all html pages to have an html content-type, except the home, and having the home loading the apps in a sandboxed iframe, via the srcdoc attribute. But, it will mean that we will have to reinvent nearly everything. Even showing an image can no longer be done via an <img> tag, it will need to use post-message with the home. Such a solution is difficult to implement, is a very fragile (both for the apps developer than for security) and is an hell to debug when it breaks. Clearly, it\u2019s not an acceptable solution. Thus, the only choice is to have several origins, and sub-domains is the best way for that. Of course, it has the downside to be more complicated to deploy (DNS and TLS certificates). But, in the tradeoff between security and ease of administration, we definetively take the security first.","title":"Rationale"},{"location":"/cozy-stack/apps/#routes_1","text":"Should we be concerned that all the routes are on the same sub-domain?

The applications metadata are stored and versioned. It can be used by a cozy to list applications to be installed, and for auto-updating the applications. We define the applications registry as an API. This should allow us to defer the real implementation of the registry storage and allow different store implementations. The stack itself implement the querying part of the registry API , proxying the request to the registries attached to the instance . Publishing on our official registries \u00b6 In order for you to publish on our official registries, please follow this howto describing how to obtain a token and parameter you repository to automatically publish versions. Channels \u00b6 We differentiate three channels of release for each application: stable: for stable releases beta: for application that can be tested in advance dev: for the latest releases directly from the trunk of the repository For each of these channels, the version string has a different format which differentiate the version channel: stable: X.Y.Z where X , Y and Z are positive or null integers. beta: X.Y.Z-beta.M where X , Y , Z and M are positive or null integers dev: X.Y.Z-dev.checksum where X , Y and Z are positive or null integers and checksum is a unique identifier of the dev release (typically a shasum of the git commit) Version order \u00b6 TLDR: 1.0.0-dev. < 1.0.0 and 1.0.0-beta. < 1.0.0, make sure you upgrade your app version after publishing stable. The order used to determine the latest version of a channel is the following: - `1.0.0-dev.* &lt; 1.0.0 (dev &lt; stable)` - `1.0.0-beta.* &lt; 1.0.0 (beta &lt; stable)` - `1.0.0-beta.1 &lt; 1.0.0-beta.2` To order beta and dev releases, we apply a sort by their creation date. Objects \u00b6 Two types of objects are managed in the registry: applications and versions. Application \u00b6 An application described a specific package. It is linked to multiple versions (releases) of the application. An application object is mutable . An application object contains the following fields: slug : the application slug (unique) type : the application type (\u201cwebapp\u201d or \u201ckonnector\u201d) editor : the application editor name versions : an object containing all the channels versions latest_version : the latest available version maintenance_activated : boolean, true when the maintenance mode is activated on the application maintenance_options : present only if maintenance_activated is true, object with the following fields: flag_infra_maintenance : bool, true iff the maintenance is internal to the cozy infrastructure flag_short_maintenance : bool, true iff the maintenance is a short maintenance, waiting for a correction on our side flag_disallow_manual_exec : bool, true iff the maintenance will disallow the execution on the application, even when manually executed messages : a list of localized messages containing a short and long information messages explaining the maintenance state label : integer for a confidence grade from 0 to 5 (A to F), labelling the application from a user privacy standpoint. It is calculated from the data_usage_commitment and data_usage_commitment_by fields. data_usage_commitment : specify a technical commitment from the application editor: user_ciphered : technical commitment that the user\u2019s data is encrypted and can only be known by him. user_reserved : commitment that the data is only used for the user, to directly offer its service. none : no commitment data_usage_commitment_by : specify what entity is taking the commitment: cozy : the commitment is taken by cozy editor : the commitment is taken by the application\u2019s editor none : no commitment is taken Example: { \"slug\" : \"drive\" , \"type\" : \"webapp\" , \"editor\" : \"cozy\" , \"versions\" : { \"stable\" : [ \"3.1.1\" ], \"beta\" : [ \"3.1.1-beta.1\" ], \"dev\" : [ \"3.1.1-dev.7a8354f74b50d7beead7719252a18ed45f55d070\" ] }, \"latest_version\" : { /* */ } } Version \u00b6 A version object describe a specific release of an application.

This namespace can contain a list of URL for the different registries attached to the stack. The stack itself implements the querying API of a registry. When querying this API, to ask for an application, the stack uses this hierarchy of registries to proxy or redirect the user. The hierarchy can also be contextualised to specify different registries to different contexts. The default context is applied lastly. Examples: \u00b6 registries : - https://myregistry.home/ - https://main.registry.cozy.io/ # In this example, a \"context1\" instance will have the equivalent of the # following list of registries: # # - https://context1.registry.cozy.io/ # - https://myregistry.home/ # - https://registry.cozy.io/ # registries : context1 : - https://context1.registry.cozy.io/ context2 : - https://context2.registry.cozy.io/ default : - https://myregistry.home/ - https://registry.cozy.io/ Authentication \u00b6 The authentication is based on a token that allow you to publish applications and versions with for one specific editor name.

For false , a more heavy solution is required: a partial index . Index selection \u00b6 CouchDB may accept or refuse to use a mango index for a query, with obsure reasons. In general, you can follow these two rules of thumb: An index on the fields foo, bar, baz can be used only to fetch documents where foo , bar , and baz exist. It means that a query that filters only on the value on foo won\u2019t use the mango index, because it can miss a document where foo has the expected value but without bar or baz . If you know that all the documents that you want have the bar and baz fields, you can just add two filters $exists: true (one for bar , the other for baz ). You should use exactly the same sequence of fields for creating the index and the sort operator of the query. If you have an index on os, browser, ip for the io.cozy.sessions.logins , and you want to have all the documents for a login from windows , sorted by browser , you can use the index, but you should use os, browser, ip for the sort (or at least os, browser , even if it is seems to weird to sort on os when all the sorted documents will have the same value, windows ).

It\u2019s possible to ask the list of the old revisions of a document with GET /db/{docid}?revs_info=true . It works only if the document has not been deleted.

First, you can add a plugin called pouchdb-debug and enable extra logs with PouchDB.debug.enable( \"pouchdb:find\" ); . This will add explanation about the queries you run in the console and it\u2019s very helpful to understand what\u2019s going on under the hood.

About indexes \u00b6 Creating an index takes some time, but the first query will also take time \u2014 you are encouraged to warm up the indexes by firing a query that uses it before it is actually needed. An exemple implementation can be found here . If there is a change in the underlying documents, the index will be partially recalculated on the next query.

Indexing more than one field \u00b6 Creating an index on several fields is not the same as creating multiple indexes on one field each. The effects of a single index on multiple fields is illustrated in the official docs and is important to understand. Furthermore, the order in which fields are indexed on a multi-index is significant, most notably when it comes to sorting. If you declare an index on the fields ['name', 'age'] , you should also sort them by ['name', 'age'] . Sorting them in a different order or using other fields will likely be done in memory and kill your performance.

Even equality operators run on secondary fields tend to be done in memory, and should therefor be used with care.","title":"Avoiding in memory selectors"},{"location":"/cozy-stack/files/","text":"Table of contents Virtual File System \u00b6 Cozy applications can use files for storing binary content, like photos or bills in PDF. This service offers a REST API to manipulate easily without having to know the underlying storage layer. The metadata are kept in CouchDB, but the binaries can go to the local system, or a Swift instance. Directories \u00b6 A directory is a container for files and sub-directories. Its path is the path of its parent, a slash ( / ), and its name. It\u2019s case sensitive. Root directory \u00b6 The root of the virtual file system is a special directory with id io.cozy.files.root-dir . You can use it in any request where you would use a directory, except you cannot delete it. POST /files/:dir-id \u00b6 Create a new directory. The dir-id parameter is optional. When it\u2019s not given, the directory is created at the root of the virtual file system.

It\u2019s simple and will work pretty well if the files are manipulated only from this application. But, files are often accessed from other apps, like cozy-desktop and cozy-drive. To improve the User eXperience, it should be nice to alert the user when a file in an album is modified or deleted. When a file is modified, we can offer the user the choice between keeping the original version in the album, or using the new modified file. When a file is moved to the trash, we can alert the user and let him/her restore the file. Cozy-desktop, cozy-drive, and the other apps can\u2019t scan all the documents with many different doctypes to find all the references to a file to detect such cases. The goal of this document is to offer a way to do that, and it is called References . The references of a file are listed in its JSON-API representation in the references field, within the relationships object of data .

Manifest 2. Intent Start 3. Service Resolution 4. Handshake 5. Processing & Terminating Routes Annexes Use cases Bibliography & Prior Art Discarded Ideas Overview \u00b6 A typical Cozy Cloud runs multiple applications, but most of these applications are focused on one task and interact with one particular type of data. However, Cozy Cloud especially shines when data is combined across apps to provide an integrated experience. This is made difficult by the fact that apps have no dedicated back-end and that they have restricted access to documents. This document outlines a proposal for apps to rely on each other to accomplish certain tasks and gain access to new documents, in a way that hopefully is neither painful for the users nor the developers. Glossary \u00b6 Intent : Intents, sometimes also called Activities, is a pattern used in environments where multiple apps with different purposes coexist. The idea is that any app can express the need to do something that it can\u2019t do itself, and an app that can do it will take over from there. Stack : refers to cozy-stack , the server-side part of the Cozy infrastructure. Client : the client is the application that starts an intent. Service : the service is the application that handles an intent started by a client. Available apps : Uninstalled applications that handles the intent. Proposal \u00b6 In this proposal, services declare themselves through their manifest. When a clients starts an intent, the stack finds the appropriate service and help the two apps to create a communication channel between them. After the channel is ready, the intent is processed. These steps are detailed below. 1. Manifest \u00b6 Every app can register itself as a potential handler for one or more intents. To do so, it must provide the following information for each intent it wishes to handle: action : A verb that describes what the service should do. The most common actions are CREATE , EDIT , OPEN , PICK , and SHARE . While we recommend using one of these verbs, the list is not exhaustive and may be extended by any app. type : One or more types of data on which the service knows how to operate the action . A type can be expressed as a MIME type or a Cozy Document Type . The application must have permissions for any Cozy Document Type listed here. You can also think of the type as the intent\u2019s subject. href : the relative URL of the route designed to handle this intent. A query-string with the intent id will be added to this URL. These informations must be provided in the manifest of the application, inside the intents key. Here is a very simple example: \"intents\" : [ { \"action\" : \"PICK\" , \"type\" : [ \"io.cozy.files\" ], \"href\" : \"/pick\" } ] When this service is called, it will load the page https://service.domain.example.com/pick?intent=123abc . Here is an example of an app that supports multiple data types: \"intents\" : [ { \"action\" : \"PICK\" , \"type\" : [ \"io.cozy.files\" , \"image/*\" ], \"href\" : \"/pick\" } ] Finally, here is an example of an app that supports several intent types: \"intents\" : [ { \"action\" : \"PICK\" , \"type\" : [ \"io.cozy.files\" , \"image/*\" ], \"href\" : \"/pick\" }, { \"action\" : \"VIEW\" , \"type\" : [ \"image/gif\" ], \"href\" : \"/viewer\" } ] This information is stored by the stack when the application is installed. 2. Intent Start \u00b6 Any app can start a new intent whenever it wants. When it does, the app becomes the client . To start an intent, it must specify the following information: action : an action verb, which will be matched against the actions declared in services manifest files. type : a single data type, which will be matched against the types declared in services manifest files. There are also two optional fields that can be defined at the start of the intent: data : Any data that the client wants to make available to the service. data must be a JSON object but its structure is left to the discretion of the client. The only exception is when type is a MIME type and the client wishes to send a file to the service. In that case, the file should be represented as a base-64 encoded Data URL and must be named content . This convention is also recomended when dealing with other intent type s. See the examples below for an example of this. permissions : When type is a Cozy Document Type and the client expects to receive one or more documents as part of the reply from the service, the permissions field allows the client to request permissions for these documents. permissions is a list of HTTP Verbs. Refer to this section of the permission documentation for more information. Note : if the intent\u2019s subject is a Cozy Doctype that holds references to other Cozy Documents (such as an album referencing photos or a playlist referencing music files), the permissions should be granted for the referenced documents too, whenever possible. Here is an example of what the API could look like: // \"Let the user pick a file\" cozy . intents . start ( 'PICK' , 'io.cozy.files' ) . then ( document => { // document is a JSON representation of the picked file }); // \"Create a contact, with some information already filled out\" cozy . intents . start ( 'CREATE' , 'io.cozy.contacts' , { name : 'John Johnsons' , tel : '+12345678' email : 'john@johnsons.com' }) . then ( document => { // document is a JSON representation of the contact that was created }); // \"Save this file somewhere\" cozy . intents . start ( 'CREATE' , 'io.cozy.files' , { content : 'data:application/zip;base64,UEsDB...' , name : 'photos.zip' }); // \"Create a new note, and give me read-only access to it\" cozy . intents . start ( 'CREATE' , 'io.cozy.notes' , {}, [ 'GET' ]) . then ( document => { // document is a JSON representation of the note that was created. // Additionally, this note can now be retrieved through the API since we have read access on it. }); // \"Create an event based on the provided data, and give me full access to it\" cozy . intents . start ( 'CREATE' , 'io.cozy.events' , { date : '2017/06/24' , title : 'Beach day' }, [ 'ALL' ]) . then ( document => { // document is a JSON representation of the note that was created. // Additionally, this note can now be retrieved through the API since we have read access on it. }); // \"Crop this picture\" cozy . intents . start ( 'EDIT' , 'image/png' , { content : 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw...' , width : 50 , height : 50 }) . then ( image => { //image is the edited version of the image provided above. }) 3. Service Resolution \u00b6 The service resolution is the phase where a service is chosen to handle an intent. This phase is handled by the stack. After the client has started it\u2019s intent, it sends the action , the type and the permissions to the stack. The stack will then traverse the list of installed apps and find all the apps that can handle that specific combination. Note that if the intent request GET permissions on a certain Cozy Document Type, but the service does not have this permission itself, it can not handle the intent. The stack then stores the information for that intent: A unique id for that intent Client URL Service URL action type permissions Finally, the service URL is suffixed with ?intent= followed by the intent\u2019s id, and then sent to the client. 4. Available apps \u00b6 In addition to the services that manage intents, a list of available (but not installed) applications of the instance that handles the intent is returned. This object list is called availableApps and contains: - The application slug - The application name Service choice \u00b6 If more than one service match the intent\u2019s criteria, the stack returns the list of all matching service URLs to the client (and stores it in the service URL version of the intent it keeps in memory). The client is then free to pick one arbitrarily. The client may also decide to let the user choose one of the services. To do this, it should start another intent with a PICK action and a io.cozy.apps type . This intent should be resolved by the stack to a special page, in order to avoid having multiple services trying to handle it and ending up in a loop. This special page is a service like any other; it expects the list of services to pick from as input data, and will return the one that has been picked to the client. The client can then proceed with the first intent. The user may decide to abort the intent before picking a service. If that is the case, the choice page will need to inform the client that the intent was aborted. No available service \u00b6 If no service is available to handle an intent, the stack returns an error to the client. However, some non-installed applications may handle the intent, and are listed in the availableApps field. 4. Handshake \u00b6 The next phase consist of the client and the service establishing a communication channel between them. The communication will be done using the window.postMessage API. Service Initialization \u00b6 When the client receives the service URL from the stack, it starts to listen for messages coming from that URL. Once the listener is started, it opens an iframe that points to the service\u2019s URL. Service to Client \u00b6 At this point, the service app is opened on the route that it provided in the href part of it\u2019s manifest. This route now also contains the intent\u2019s id. The service queries the stack to find out information about the intent, passing along the intent id. In response, the stack sends the client\u2019s URL, the action , and the type . If the intent includes permissions , the stack sends them too, as well as the client\u2019s permission id. It then starts to listen for messages coming from the client\u2019s URL. Eventually, it sends a message to the client, as a mean to inform it that the service is now ready. Client to Service \u00b6 After the client receives the \u201cready\u201d message from the service, it sends a message to the service acknowledging the \u201cready\u201d state. Along with this message, it should send the data that was provided at the start of the intent, if any. 5. Processing & Terminating \u00b6 After this handshake, there is a confirmed communication channel between the client and the service, and the service knows what it has to do. This is the phase where the user interacts with the service. If the service is going to grant extra permissions to the client app, it is strongly recommended to make this clear to the user. When the service has finished his task, it sends a \u201ccompleted\u201d message to the client. Permissions extensions should have been done before that. Along with the completed message, the service should send any data it deems relevant. This data should be a JSON object. Again, the structure of that object is left to the discretion of the service, except when type is a MIME type. In that case, the file should be represented as a base-64 encoded Data URL and must be named content . This convention is also recomended when dealing with other intent type s. After the client receives a \u201ccompleted\u201d message, it can close the service\u2019s iframe and resume operations as usual. If, for whatever reason, the service can not fulfill the intent, it can send an \u201cerror\u201d message to the client. When the client receives an \u201cerror\u201d message, the intent is aborted and the iframe can be closed. Routes \u00b6 POST /intents \u00b6 The client app can ask to start an intent via this route. Any client-side app can call this route, no permission is needed. Request \u00b6 POST /intents HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.net Authorization : Bearer eyJhbG...

Since we were unable to find a use case where a new window is required, we decided not to include the disposition in this specification. It might be added later if the need arises. Client / Server architecture \u00b6 Instead of letting the two applications communicate with each other, they could be made to talk through the stack. This would be useful as the stack could act as a middleware, transforming data on the fly or granting permissions where appropriate. However, this approach has also severe drawbacks, notably the fact that the stack must hold a copy of all the data that the apps want to transfer (which can include large files). It also makes it significantly harder for the client to know when the intent has been processed. Data representation \u00b6 The client could explicitly request a data format to be used in the communication. However, this idea was abandoned because the format is always json, except when then intent\u2019s type is a MIME type, in which case the data format also uses this type.","title":"/intents - Intents"},{"location":"/cozy-stack/intents/#intents","text":"Overview Glossary Proposal 1.

To do so, it must provide the following information for each intent it wishes to handle: action : A verb that describes what the service should do. The most common actions are CREATE , EDIT , OPEN , PICK , and SHARE . While we recommend using one of these verbs, the list is not exhaustive and may be extended by any app. type : One or more types of data on which the service knows how to operate the action . A type can be expressed as a MIME type or a Cozy Document Type . The application must have permissions for any Cozy Document Type listed here. You can also think of the type as the intent\u2019s subject. href : the relative URL of the route designed to handle this intent. A query-string with the intent id will be added to this URL. These informations must be provided in the manifest of the application, inside the intents key. Here is a very simple example: \"intents\" : [ { \"action\" : \"PICK\" , \"type\" : [ \"io.cozy.files\" ], \"href\" : \"/pick\" } ] When this service is called, it will load the page https://service.domain.example.com/pick?intent=123abc .

To start an intent, it must specify the following information: action : an action verb, which will be matched against the actions declared in services manifest files. type : a single data type, which will be matched against the types declared in services manifest files. There are also two optional fields that can be defined at the start of the intent: data : Any data that the client wants to make available to the service. data must be a JSON object but its structure is left to the discretion of the client. The only exception is when type is a MIME type and the client wishes to send a file to the service. In that case, the file should be represented as a base-64 encoded Data URL and must be named content . This convention is also recomended when dealing with other intent type s. See the examples below for an example of this. permissions : When type is a Cozy Document Type and the client expects to receive one or more documents as part of the reply from the service, the permissions field allows the client to request permissions for these documents. permissions is a list of HTTP Verbs. Refer to this section of the permission documentation for more information.

This doc introduces two cozy types: io.cozy.jobs for jobs io.cozy.triggers for triggers Triggers \u00b6 Jobs can be queued up via the /jobs/queue/:worker-type API, for a direct execution. But it can also be convenient to schedule jobs on some conditions, and the triggers are the way to do that. Jobs can be launched by five different types of triggers: @at to schedule a one-time job executed after at a specific time in the future @in to schedule a one-time job executed after a specific amount of time @every to schedule periodic jobs executed at a given fix interval @cron to schedule recurring jobs scheduled at specific times @event to launch a job after a change on documents in the cozy. These five triggers have specific syntaxes to describe when jobs should be scheduled. See below for more informations. @at syntax \u00b6 The @at trigger takes a ISO-8601 formatted string indicating a UTC time in the future. The date is of this form: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ Examples @at 2018-12-12T15:36:25.507Z @in syntax \u00b6 The @in trigger takes the same duration syntax as @every Examples @in 10m @in 1h30m @every syntax \u00b6 The @every trigger uses the same syntax as golang\u2019s time.ParseDuration (but only support time units above seconds): A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as \u201c300ms\u201d, \u201c1.5h\u201d or \u201c2h45m\u201d. Valid time units are \u201cs\u201d, \u201cm\u201d, \u201ch\u201d. Examples @every 1.5h # schedules every 1 and a half hours @every 30m10s # schedules every 30 minutes and 10 seconds @cron syntax \u00b6 In order to schedule recurring jobs, the @cron trigger has the syntax using six fields: Field name Mandatory? Allowed values Allowed special characters Seconds Yes 0-59 * / , - Minutes Yes 0-59 * / , - Hours Yes 0-23 * / , - Day of month Yes 1-31 * / , - ? Month Yes 1-12 or JAN-DEC * / , - Day of week Yes 0-6 or SUN-SAT * / , - ? Asterisk ( * ) The asterisk indicates that the cron expression will match for all values of the field; e.g., using an asterisk in the 5th field (month) would indicate every month. Slash ( / ) Slashes are used to describe increments of ranges. For example 3-59/15 in the 1st field (minutes) would indicate the 3rd minute of the hour and every 15 minutes thereafter. The form \"*\\/...\" is equivalent to the form \"first-last/...\" , that is, an increment over the largest possible range of the field. The form \"N-/...\" is accepted as meaning \"N-MAX/...\" , that is, starting at N, use the increment until the end of that specific range. It does not wrap around. Comma ( , ) Commas are used to separate items of a list. For example, using \"MON,WED,FRI\" in the 5th field (day of week) would mean Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Hyphen ( - ) Hyphens are used to define ranges. For example, 9-17 would indicate every hour between 9am and 5pm inclusive. Question mark ( ? ) Question mark may be used instead of * for leaving either day-of-month or day-of-week blank. To schedule jobs given an interval: Examples: @cron 0 0 0 1 1 * # Run once a year, midnight, Jan. 1st @cron 0 0 0 1 1 * # Run once a year, midnight, Jan. 1st @cron 0 0 0 1 * * # Run once a month, midnight, first of month @cron 0 0 0 * * 0 # Run once a week, midnight on Sunday @cron 0 0 0 * * * # Run once a day, midnight @cron 0 0 * * * * # Run once an hour, beginning of hour @event syntax \u00b6 The @event syntax allows to trigger a job when something occurs in the stack. It follows the same syntax than permissions scope string: type[:verb][:values][:selector] Unlike for permissions string, the verb should be one of CREATED , DELETED , UPDATED . The job worker will receive a compound message including original trigger_infos messages and the event which has triggered it. Examples @event io.cozy.files // anything happens on files @event io.cozy.files:CREATED // a file was created @event io.cozy.files:DELETED:image/jpg:mime // an image was deleted @event io.cozy.bank.operations:CREATED io.cozy.bank.bills:CREATED // a bank operation or a bill @event io.cozy.bank.operations:CREATED,UPDATED // a bank operation created or updated Error Handling \u00b6 Jobs can fail to execute their task. We have two ways to parameterize such cases. Retry \u00b6 A retry count can be optionally specified to ask the worker to re-execute the task if it has failed. Each retry is executed after a configurable delay. The try count is part of the attributes of the job. Also, each occurring error is kept in the errors field containing all the errors that may have happened. Timeout \u00b6 A worker may never end. To prevent this, a configurable timeout value is specified with the job. If a job does not end after the specified amount of time, it will be aborted. A timeout is just like another error from the worker and can provoke a retry if specified. Defaults \u00b6 By default, jobs are parameterized with a maximum of 3 tries with 1 minute timeout. These defaults may vary given the workload of the workers. Jobs API \u00b6 Example and description of the attributes of a io.cozy.jobs : { \"domain\" : \"me.cozy.tools\" , \"worker\" : \"sendmail\" , // worker type name \"options\" : { \"priority\" : 3 , // priority from 1 to 100, higher number is higher priority \"timeout\" : 60 , // timeout value in seconds \"max_exec_count\" : 3 , // maximum number of time the job should be executed (including retries) }, \"arguments\" : { // the arguments will be given to the worker (if you look in CouchDB, it is called message there) \"mode\" : \"noreply\" , \"template_name\" : \"new_registration\" , \"template_values\" : { \"DevicesLink\" : \"http://me.cozy.tools/#/connectedDevices\" , } }, \"state\" : \"running\" , // queued, running, errored \"queued_at\" : \"2016-09-19T12:35:08Z\" , // time of the queuing \"started_at\" : \"2016-09-19T12:35:08Z\" , // time of first execution \"error\" : \"\" // error message if any } Example and description of a job creation options \u2014 as you can see, the options are replicated in the io.cozy.jobs attributes: { \"priority\" : 3 , // priority from 1 to 100 \"timeout\" : 60 , // timeout value in seconds \"max_exec_count\" : 3 , // maximum number of retry } GET /jobs/:job-id \u00b6 Get a job informations given its ID. Request \u00b6 GET /jobs/123123 HTTP / 1.1 Accept : application/vnd.api+json Response \u00b6 { \"data\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.jobs\" , \"id\" : \"123123\" , \"attributes\" : { \"domain\" : \"me.cozy.tools\" , \"worker\" : \"sendmail\" , \"options\" : { \"priority\" : 3 , \"timeout\" : 60 , \"max_exec_count\" : 3 }, \"state\" : \"running\" , \"queued_at\" : \"2016-09-19T12:35:08Z\" , \"started_at\" : \"2016-09-19T12:35:08Z\" , \"error\" : \"\" }, \"links\" : { \"self\" : \"/jobs/123123\" } } } POST /jobs/queue/:worker-type \u00b6 Enqueue programmatically a new job. This route requires a specific permission on the worker-type. A global permission on the global io.cozy.jobs doctype is not allowed. Each worker accepts different arguments. For konnectors, the arguments will be given in the COZY_FIELDS env variable. Request \u00b6 POST /jobs/queue/sendmail HTTP / 1.1 Accept : application/vnd.api+json { \"data\" : { \"attributes\" : { \"options\" : { \"priority\" : 3 , \"timeout\" : 60 , \"max_exec_count\" : 3 }, \"arguments\" : {} // any json value used as arguments for the job } } } Response \u00b6 { \"data\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.jobs\" , \"id\" : \"123123\" , \"attributes\" : { \"domain\" : \"me.cozy.tools\" , \"worker\" : \"sendmail\" , \"options\" : { \"priority\" : 3 , \"timeout\" : 60 , \"max_exec_count\" : 3 }, \"state\" : \"running\" , \"queued_at\" : \"2016-09-19T12:35:08Z\" , \"started_at\" : \"2016-09-19T12:35:08Z\" , \"error\" : \"\" }, \"links\" : { \"self\" : \"/jobs/123123\" } } } Permissions \u00b6 To use this endpoint, an application needs a permission on the type io.cozy.jobs for the verb POST . The is required to restrict its permission to specific worker(s), like this (a global permission on the doctype is not allowed): { \"permissions\" : { \"mail-from-the-user\" : { \"description\" : \"Required to send mails from the user to his/her friends\" , \"type\" : \"io.cozy.jobs\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"POST\" ], \"selector\" : \"worker\" , \"values\" : [ \"sendmail\" ] } } } GET /jobs/queue/:worker-type \u00b6 List the jobs in the queue. Request \u00b6 GET /jobs/queue/sendmail HTTP / 1.1 Accept : application/vnd.api+json Response \u00b6 { \"data\" : [ { \"attributes\" : { \"domain\" : \"cozy.tools:8080\" , \"options\" : null , \"queued_at\" : \"2017-09-29T15:32:31.953878568+02:00\" , \"started_at\" : \"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z\" , \"state\" : \"queued\" , \"worker\" : \"log\" }, \"id\" : \"77689bca9634b4fb08d6ca3d1643de5f\" , \"links\" : { \"self\" : \"/jobs/log/77689bca9634b4fb08d6ca3d1643de5f\" }, \"meta\" : { \"rev\" : \"1-f823bcd2759103a5ad1a98f4bf083b36\" }, \"type\" : \"io.cozy.jobs\" } ], \"meta\" : { \"count\" : 0 } } Permissions \u00b6 To use this endpoint, an application needs a permission on the type io.cozy.jobs for the verb GET . In most cases, the application will restrict its permission to only one worker, like this: { \"permissions\" : { \"mail-from-the-user\" : { \"description\" : \"Required to know the number of jobs in the sendmail queues\" , \"type\" : \"io.cozy.jobs\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"GET\" ], \"selector\" : \"worker\" , \"values\" : [ \"sendmail\" ] } } } POST /jobs/triggers \u00b6 Add a trigger of the worker. See triggers\u2019 descriptions to see the types of trigger and their arguments syntax. This route requires a specific permission on the worker type. A global permission on the global io.cozy.triggers doctype is not allowed. The debounce parameter can be used to limit the number of jobs created in a burst. It delays the creation of the job on the first input by the given time argument, and if the trigger has its condition matched again during this period, it won\u2019t create another job. It can be useful to combine it with the changes feed of couchdb with a last sequence number persisted by the worker, as it allows to have a nice diff between two executions of the worker. Request \u00b6 POST /jobs/triggers HTTP / 1.1 Accept : application/vnd.api+json { \"data\" : { \"attributes\" : { \"type\" : \"@event\" , \"arguments\" : \"io.cozy.invitations\" , \"debounce\" : \"10m\" , \"worker\" : \"sendmail\" , \"message\" : {}, \"options\" : { \"priority\" : 3 , \"timeout\" : 60 , \"max_exec_count\" : 3 } } } } Note : the message field was previously called worker_arguments . The latter version still works but is deprecated, you should use message instead.

DELETE /jobs/purge \u00b6 This endpoint allows to purge old jobs of an instance. Some parameters can be given to this route: duration is the duration of jobs to keep. This is a human-readable string (integer+suffix). For example: \u201c3W\u201d will keep jobs up to 3 weeks \u201c2M\u201d will keep jobs up to 2 months workers is a comma-separated list of workers to apply the purge job. Request \u00b6 DELETE /jobs/purge HTTP / 1.1 Accept : application/json Response \u00b6 { \"deleted\" : 42 } Permissions \u00b6 To use this endpoint, an application needs a permission on the type io.cozy.jobs for the verb DELETE .

GET /jobs/triggers \u00b6 Get the list of triggers. Query parameters: Worker : to filter only triggers associated with a specific worker. Request \u00b6 GET /jobs/triggers?Worker=konnector HTTP / 1.1 Accept : application/vnd.api+json Response \u00b6 { \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.triggers\" , \"id\" : \"123123\" , \"attributes\" : {}, \"links\" : { \"self\" : \"/jobs/triggers/123123\" } } ] } Permissions \u00b6 To use this endpoint, an application needs a permission on the type io.cozy.triggers for the verb GET . When used on a specific worker, the permission can be specified on the worker field. Worker pool \u00b6 The consuming side of the job queue is handled by a worker pool. On a monolithic cozy-stack, the worker pool has a configurable fixed size of workers. The default value is not yet determined. Each time a worker has finished a job, it check the queue and based on the priority and the queued date of the job, picks a new job to execute. Permissions \u00b6 In order to prevent jobs from leaking informations between applications, we may need to add filtering per applications: for instance one queue per applications. We should also have an explicit check on the permissions of the applications before launching a job scheduled by an application. For more information, refer to our permission document . Multi-stack \u00b6 When some instances are served by several stacks, the scheduling and running of jobs can be distributed on the stacks. The synchronization is done via redis. For scheduling, there is one important key in redis: triggers . It\u2019s a sorted set. The members are the identifiants of the triggers (with the domain name), and the score are the timestamp of the next time the trigger should occur. During the short period of time where a trigger is processed, its key is moved to scheduling (another sorted set). So, even if a stack crash during processing a trigger, this trigger won\u2019t be lost. For @event triggers, we don\u2019t use the same mechanism. Each stack has all the triggers in memory and is responsible to trigger them for the events generated by the HTTP requests of their API. They also publish them on redis: this pub/sub is used for the realtime API.","title":"/jobs - Jobs"},{"location":"/cozy-stack/jobs/#jobs","text":"Jobs are designed to represent asynchronous tasks that your cozy can execute.

It can useful for debugging for example. thumbnail worker \u00b6 The thumbnail worker is used internally by the stack to generate thumbnails from the image files of a cozy instance. service worker \u00b6 The service worker is used to process background jobs, generally to compute non-realtime user data. push worker \u00b6 The push worker can be used to send push-notifications to a user\u2019s device. The options are: client_id : the ID of the oauth client to push a notification to. title : the title of the notification message : the content of the notification data : key-value string map for additional metadata (optional) priority : the notification priority: high or normal (optional) topic : the topic identifier of the notification (optional) sound : a sound associated with the notification (optional) Example \u00b6 { \"client_id\" : \"abcdef123123123\" , \"title\" : \"My Notification\" , \"message\" : \"My notification content.\" , \"priority\" : \"high\" } Permissions \u00b6 To use this worker from a client-side application, you will need to ask the permission. It is done by adding this to the manifest: { \"permissions\" : { \"push-notification\" : { \"description\" : \"Required to send notifications\" , \"type\" : \"io.cozy.jobs\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"POST\" ], \"selector\" : \"worker\" , \"values\" : [ \"push\" ] } } } unzip worker \u00b6 The unzip worker can take a zip archive from the VFS, and will unzip the files inside it to a directory of the VFS. The options are: zip : the ID of the zip file destination : the ID of the directory where the files will be unzipped. Example \u00b6 { \"zip\" : \"8737b5d6-51b6-11e7-9194-bf5b64b3bc9e\" , \"destination\" : \"88750a84-51b6-11e7-ba90-4f0b1cb62b7b\" } Permissions \u00b6 To use this worker from a client-side application, you will need to ask the permission.

It implies that the stack has properly configured an access to an SMTP server. You can see an example of configuration in the cozy.example.yaml file at the root of this repository. sendmail options fields are the following: mode : string specifying the mode of the send: noreply to send a notification mail to the user from to send a mail from the user to : list of object {name, email} representing the addresses of the recipients. (should not be used in noreply mode) subject : string specifying the subject of the mail parts : list of part objects {type, body} listing representing the content parts of the type string of the content type: either text/html or text/plain body string of the actual body content of the part attachments : list of objects {filename, content} that represent the files attached to the email Examples \u00b6 // from mode sending mail from the user to a list of recipients { \"mode\" : \"from\" , \"to\" : [ { \"name\" : \"John Doe 1\" , \"email\" : \"john1@doe\" }, { \"name\" : \"John Doe 2\" , \"email\" : \"john2@doe\" } ], \"subject\" : \"Hey !\" , \"parts\" : [ { \"type\" : \"text/html\" , \"body\" : \"<h1>Hey !</h1>\" }, { \"type\" : \"text/plain\" , \"body\" : \"Hey !\" } ] } // noreply mode, sending a notification mail to the user { \"mode\" : \"noreply\" , \"subject\" : \"You've got a new file !\" , \"parts\" : [ { \"type\" : \"text/html\" , \"body\" : \"<h1>Hey !</h1>\" }, { \"type\" : \"text/plain\" , \"body\" : \"Hey !\" } ] } Permissions \u00b6 To use this worker from a client-side application, you will need to ask the permission.

At the end of the export, a mail is sent to the user containing a link to access to its data. The progress of the export process can be followed with realtime events on the doctype io.cozy.exports . Its options are: parts_size : the size in bytes of the sizes index splitting done for multi-part download of files data max_age : the maximum age duration of the archive before it expires with_doctypes : list of string for a whitelist of doctypes to exports (exports all doctypes if empty) without_files : boolean to avoid exporting the index (preventing download file data) Example \u00b6 { \"parts_size\" : 52428800 , \"max_age\" : 60000000000 , // 1 minute \"with_doctypes\" : [ \"io.cozy.accounts\" ], // empty or null means all doctypes \"without_files\" : false } Permissions \u00b6 To use this worker from a client-side application, you will need to ask the permission.

The event is similar to a realtime event: a verb, a document, and optionaly the old version of this document. Share-replicate and share-upload \u00b6 The message is composed of a sharing ID and a count of the number of errors (i.e. the number of times this job was retried). migrations \u00b6 The migrations worker can be used to migrate a cozy instance that has its files in swift from a V1 or V2 layout to a V3 layout. Currently, it has a single option, type , with a single supported value, to-swift-v3 . Example \u00b6 It can be launched from command-line with: $ cozy-stack jobs run migrations --domain example.mycozy.cloud --json '{\"type\": \"to-swift-v3\"}' Deprecated workers \u00b6 updates \u00b6 The updates worker was used for updating applications when there were no auto-update mechanism.","title":" /jobs - Workers"},{"location":"/cozy-stack/workers/#workers","text":"This page list all the currently available workers on the cozy-stack.

It allows to let the owner of the cozy instance controls the access to her data, files and actions on them. The permissions are given in several contexts. Let\u2019s see them! Client-side apps \u00b6 When the user installs a new client-side app, she is asked to accept an initial set of permissions for this app. This set of permissions is described in the manifest of the app. Later, the application can gain more permissions via the intents and optional permissions. See below for more details. When the authentified user access a client-side app, the app receives a token from the stack that can be used in later requests to the stack as a proof of the permissions it owns. External apps via OAuth2 \u00b6 An external application can ask for permissions via the OAuth2 dance, and use them later with the access token. The permissions are in the scope parameter. Sharing with other users \u00b6 The owner of a cozy instance can share some documents and files with other users. It can be done in two ways: If the other user also has a cozy, it can be a cozy-to-cozy sharing. Else, the owner can give to him a link with a code or a shortcode. What is a permission? \u00b6 A permission gives the right for a request having it to do something on the stack. It is defined by four components. Type \u00b6 type is the attribute used in JSON-API or the docType for the Data System. It is the only mandatory component. If just the type is specified, it gives access to all the operations on this type . For example, a permission on type io.cozy.contacts gives the right to create, read, update and delete any contact, and to fetch all the contacts. A permission on type io.cozy.files allow to access and modify any file or directory. Some known types: io.cozy.files , for files and folder in the VFS io.cozy.apps , for apps io.cozy.settings , for the settings io.cozy.jobs and io.cozy.triggers , for jobs io.cozy.oauth.clients , to list and revoke OAuth 2 clients Verbs \u00b6 It says which HTTP verbs can be used for requests to the cozy-stack. GET will give read-only access, DELETE can be used for deletions, etc. Verbs should be declared in a list, like [\"GET\", \"POST\", \"DELETE\"] , and use [\"ALL\"] as a shortcut for [\"GET\", \"POST\", \"PUT\", \"PATCH\", \"DELETE\"] (it is the default). Note : HEAD is implicitely implied when GET is allowed. OPTIONS for Cross-Origin Resources Sharing is always allowed, the stack does not have the informations about the permission when it answers the request. Values \u00b6 It\u2019s possible to restrict the permissions to only some documents of a docType, or to just some files and folders. You can give a list of ids in values . Note : a permission for a folder also gives permissions with same verbs for files and folders inside it. Selector \u00b6 By default, the values are checked with the id . But it\u2019s possible to use a selector to filter on another field . In particular, it can be used for sharing. A user may share a calendar and all the events inside it. It will be done with two permissions. The first one is for the calendar: { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.calendars\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"GET\" ], \"values\" : [ \"1355812c-d41e-11e6-8467-53be4648e3ad\" ] } And the other is for the events inside the calendar: { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.events\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"GET\" ], \"selector\" : \"calendar-id\" , \"values\" : [ \"1355812c-d41e-11e6-8467-53be4648e3ad\" ] } What format for a permission? \u00b6 JSON \u00b6 The prefered format for permissions is JSON.

Ie, I have a folder opened in cozy-files on the browser, I take some pictures from my smartphone, the pictures appears in the folder without me needing to refresh the browser tab. What couchdb offers \u00b6 Couchdb supports with its _changes API both events feeds types: using since=now&continuous=true we get all events continuous ly as they happen (SSE) using since=(last known seq_number) we get all changes in the interval between last known seq_number and now. Couchdb also offers a _db_updates route, which give us continuous changes at the database level. This routes does not support a since parameter, as there is no global seq_number . Other events will be generated from the stack itself, such as session close or jobs activity. Performance limitation \u00b6 We cannot have a continuous _changes feed open to every databases Use cases for interval events feeds \u00b6 Replication \u00b6 Couchdb replication algorithm can work in one-shot mode, where it replicates changes since last sync up until now, or in continuous mode where it replicates changes as they happens. The stack will not allow continuous mode for replication. This is already supported with the _changes route Sharing \u00b6 Our sharing is based on couchdb replication rules, so also depends on _changes feed to ensure all changes have been applied. Considering these use cases, there is no need for non-couchdb event to be part of the interval events feed. Use cases for continuous events feeds \u00b6 Realtime \u00b6 Some events should be send to the client to update views as data change. @event jobs trigger \u00b6 Some event will trigger the activation of a job (ie.

Our proposal is to make client side apps able to query external websites of their choices, but these requests will be made via the cozy-stack (as a proxy) and will be logged to check later that no personal data was leaked unintentionally. We can see the data loaded from the external website as a document with a doctype: it\u2019s just not a doctype local to our cozy, but a remote one. A client side app can request data from external websites by doing these three steps: Declaring a remote doctype and its requests Declaring permissions on these doctypes in the manifest Calling the /remote API of cozy-stack Declaring a remote doctype \u00b6 Doctypes are formalized in this repository: github.com/cozy/cozy-doctypes . Each doctype has its own directory inside the repository. For a remote doctype, it will include a file called request that will describe how the cozy-stack will request the external website.

Each one has a request defined for it. The format for the request file is: the verb and the URL on the first line then some lines that describe the HTTP headers then a blank line and the body if the request is a POST For the path, the query-string, the headers, and the body, it\u2019s possible to have some dynamic part by using {{ , a variable name, and }} . Some templating helpers are available to escape specific variables using {{ function name - space - variable name }} . These helpers are only available for the body part of the template. Available helpers: json : for json parts ( { \"key\": \"{{json val}}\" } ) html : for html parts ( <p>{{html val}}</p> ) query : for query parameter of a url ( http://foobar.com?q={{query q}} ) path : for path component of a url ( http://foobar.com/{{path p}} ) Values injected in the URL are automatically URI-escaped based on the part they are included in: namely as a query parameter or as a path component. Note : by default, the User-Agent is set to a default value (\u201ccozy-stack\u201d and a version number). It can be overriden in the request description. Example: GET https://foobar.com/ {{ path }} ?q= {{ query }} Content-Type: {{ contentType }} { \"key\": \" {{ json value }} \", \"url\": \"http://anotherurl.com/ {{ path anotherPath }} ?q= {{ query anotherQuery }} \", } Declaring permissions \u00b6 Nothing special here.

Example: GET /remote/org.wikidata.search?q=Douglas+Adams HTTP / 1.1 Host : alice.cozy.tools It is possible to send some extra informations, to make it easier to understand the request. If no variable in the request matches it, it won\u2019t be send to the remote website.

Sharing by links \u00b6 A client-side application can propose sharing by links: The application must have a public route in its manifest. See Apps documentation for how to do that. The application can create a set of permissions for the shared documents, with codes. Another code called shortcode is also generated and associated with the code. This shortcode is much smaller (but secure), which is easier to be shared. See permissions documentation for the details. The application can then create a shareable link (e.g. https://calendar.cozy.example.net/public?sharecode=eiJ3iepoaihohz1Y ) by putting together the app sub-domain, the public route path, and a code for the permissions set. The app can then send this link by mail, via the jobs system , or just give it to the user, so he can transmit it to her friends via chat or other ways. When someone opens the shared link, the stack will load the public route, find the corresponding index.html file, and replace {{.Token}} inside it by a token with the same set of permissions that sharecode offers. This token can then be used as a Bearer token in the Authorization header for requests to the stack (or via cozy-client-js). NB: The shortcode can also be used as the Bearer . In this case, the corresponding sharecode will be matched on server-side If necessary, the application can list the permissions for the token by calling /permissions/self with this token. Cozy to cozy sharing \u00b6 The owner of a cozy instance can send and synchronize documents to others cozy users. Intents \u00b6 When a sharing is authorized, the user is redirected to their cozy on the application that was used for the sharing (when possible). It\u2019s possible to use a specific route to do so, via the intents. The application must declare an intent in its manifest for the action SHARING . The doctype of the intent must be the same as the doctype of the first rule of the sharing. In the redirect URL, the query string will have a sharing parameter with the sharing ID (but no intent parameter). Routes \u00b6 POST /sharings/ \u00b6 Create a new sharing. The sharing rules and recipients must be specified. The description , preview_path , and open_sharing fields are optional. The app_slug field is optional and is the slug of the web app by default. To create a sharing, no permissions on io.cozy.sharings are needed: an application can create a sharing on the documents for whose it has a permission.

On this page, they can fill the URL of their Cozy (if the user has already filled its Cozy URL in a previous sharing, the form will be pre-filled and the user will just have to click OK). Query-String \u00b6 Parameter Description state a code that identify the recipient Example \u00b6 GET /sharings/ce8835a061d0ef68947afe69a0046722/discovery?state=eiJ3iepoaihohz1Y HTTP / 1.1 Host : alice.example.net POST /sharings/:sharing-id/discovery \u00b6 Give to the cozy of the sharer the URL of the Cozy of one recipient. The sharer will register its-self as an OAuth client on the recipient cozy, and then will ask the recipient to accept the permissions on its instance. This route exists in two versions, the version is selected by the HTTP header Accept Classical ( x-www-form-urlencoded ) \u00b6 Parameter Description state a code that identify the recipient url the URL of the Cozy for the recipient Example \u00b6 POST /sharings/ce8835a061d0ef68947afe69a0046722/discovery HTTP / 1.1 Host : alice.example.org Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded Accept : text/html state=eiJ3iepoaihohz1Y&url=https://bob.example.net/ HTTP / 1.1 302 Moved Temporarily Location : https://bob.example.net/auth/sharing?... JSON \u00b6 This version can be more convenient for applications that implement the preview page. To do that, an application must give a preview_path when creating the sharing. This path must be a public route of this application. The recipients will receive a link to the application subdomain, on this page, and with a sharecode in the query string (like for a share by link). To know the sharing-id , it\u2019s possible to ask GET /permissions/self , with the sharecode in the Authorization header (it\u2019s a JWT token).

The application can then create a shareable link (e.g. https://calendar.cozy.example.net/public?sharecode=eiJ3iepoaihohz1Y ) by putting together the app sub-domain, the public route path, and a code for the permissions set. The app can then send this link by mail, via the jobs system , or just give it to the user, so he can transmit it to her friends via chat or other ways. When someone opens the shared link, the stack will load the public route, find the corresponding index.html file, and replace {{.Token}} inside it by a token with the same set of permissions that sharecode offers. This token can then be used as a Bearer token in the Authorization header for requests to the stack (or via cozy-client-js). NB: The shortcode can also be used as the Bearer .

Authoring a link What is it ? \u00b6 Cozy Link is a simple yet powerful way to describe how you want to get the result of a query. Think of it as a sort of \u201cmiddleware\u201d. Links are units that you can chain together to define how each query should be handled: this allows us to use different sources of data, or to control the request lifecycle in a way that makes sense for your app. The first link operates on an operation object and each subsequent link operates on the result of the previous link: In the chain example pictured above, the Dedup link would avoid re-fetching the same query, the PouchDB link would try to get the data from a local Pouch instance, and fallback to the Stack link, assisted by the Retry link that will try to fetch again the query in case of a network error. Authoring a link \u00b6 There are two ways of creating a new link. First, you can instantiate a CozyLink and pass a request handling function to its constructor: const logLink = new CozyLink (( operation , result , forward ) => { console . log ( JSON . stringify ( operation )) return forward ( operation , result ) }) Or you can subclass CozyLink : class LogLink extends CozyLink { request ( operation , result , forward ) { console . log ( JSON . stringify ( operation )) return forward ( operation , result ) } } At the core of a link is the request method. It takes the following arguments: - operation : the operation definition being passed through the link ; - result : the (maybe incomplete) result processed by the previous link ; - forward : (optional) specifies the next link in the chain of links. When the request method is called, the link has to return data back. Depending on where the link is in the chain, and its ability to provide the requested data, it will either use the forward callback to defer to the next link the task of providing (or completing) the data, or return back a result on its own.","title":"link-authoring"},{"location":"/cozy-client/link-authoring/#what-is-it","text":"Cozy Link is a simple yet powerful way to describe how you want to get the result of a query.

How to logout the client ? Support offline for some doctypes with cozy-pouch-link Using CozyClient on a mobile app \u00b6 Configuration \ud83d\udee0 \u00b6 On the web, the server pass the token and the domain to the page directly through template variables. This is not possible on mobile as there is no server to serve the page. CozyClient supports connecting to a Cozy via OAtuh. To get started, configure the OAuth settings when creating the client: import CozyClient from 'cozy-client' const client = new CozyClient ({ uri : 'http://cozy.tools:8080' , scope : [ 'io.cozy.mydoctype' ], oauth : { clientName : 'MyClient' , softwareID : 'MyAppId' , redirectURI : 'http://localhost' } }) scope is an array of permissions you require for your client oauth is a list of fields that identify your client for the user and the server. The complete list of field can be found here , although they should be camel-cased instead of snake-cased. Starting the OAuth flow \ud83c\udfc4\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \u00b6 Before you can start making requests to the server, you will need to get a token. cozy-client will provide a URL to a page where the user is shown what data you want to access, and asking for his or her permission. After the user accepts these permissions, he or she is redirected to the oauth.redirectURI that you declared earlier. You will then have to give this redirected URL back to cozy-client as it contains a code, that will be exchanged for the token. To get started, you call client.startOAuthFlow like this: import CozyClient from 'cozy-client' const client = new CozyClient ({ uri : 'http://cozy.tools:8080' , scope : [ 'io.cozy.mydoctype' ], oauth : { clientName : 'MyClient' , softwareID : 'MyAppId' , redirectURI : 'http://localhost' } }) client . startOAuthFlow ( openURL ) The openURL parameter is a callback. It will receive the URL to the page as a parameter, and it must return a Promise that resolves with the redirected URL. How exactly you do this depends on your environment \u2014 for a mobile app you may use a WebView, in a browser maybe a new tab\u2026 Here is an example that uses the browser\u2019s console and an experienced user: const openURL = url => { console . log ( 'Please visit the following URL, accept the permissions and copy the URL you are redirected to, then come back here. you have 10 seconds.' , url ) return new Promise ( resolve => { setTimeout ( async () => { const returnUrl = prompt ( 'Paste the new URL here.' ) resolve ( returnUrl ) }, 10000 ) }) } And that\u2019s it! After the promise is resolved, cozy-client finishes the OAuth flow and you can start using it. How to restore a previous token ? \u00b6 Nobody likes to enter passwords, and you don\u2019t want to make your user go through this whole process every time your app starts. In order to restore the client from a previous version, you need to give it a token and some extra information about itself. Both of these are returned by the openURL function, so you can store them wherever you see fit \u2014 in this example we\u2019ll use the localStorage API. import CozyClient from 'cozy-client' const client = new CozyClient ({ uri : 'http://cozy.tools:8080' , scope : [ 'io.cozy.mydoctype' ], oauth : { clientName : 'MyClient' , softwareID : 'MyAppId' , redirectURI : 'http://localhost' } }) const { token , infos } = client . startOAuthFlow ( openURL ) localStorage . setItem ( 'token' , token ) localStorage . setItem ( 'infos' , JSON . stringify ( infos )) Next time your app starts, you can pass these informations to the constructor. Here is a complete example of the OAuth client initilisation: const storedToken = localStorage . getItem ( 'token' ) || null const storedInfos = JSON . parse ( localStorage . getItem ( 'infos' )) || { clientName : 'MyClient' , softwareID : 'MyAppId' , redirectURI : 'http://localhost' } const client = new CozyClient ({ uri : 'http://cozy.tools:8080' , oauth : storedInfos , token : storedToken , scope : [ 'io.cozy.mydoctype' ] }); if ( ! storedToken ) { const { token , infos } = await client . startOAuthFlow ( openURL ) localStorage . setItem ( 'token' , token ) localStorage . setItem ( 'infos' , JSON . stringify ( infos )) } How to logout the client ? \u00b6 When a user logout, we would like remove all references on this instance and remove all user data. You can just use cozyClient.logout() . Support offline for some doctypes with cozy-pouch-link \u00b6 If you are already using cozy-client and the StackLink , you may want to go further and store some documents locally so you can retrieve them even while being offline. Currently, you have a code like this one : import CozyClient , { StackLink } from 'cozy-client' const stackLink = new StackLink () const client = new CozyClient ({ // ... links : [ stackLink ] }) To manage the offline aspect, we provide the cozy-pouch-link . First, let\u2019s install it : # using npm npm install cozy-pouch-link # using yarn yarn add cozy-pouch-link Then, we will create a new instance of this link and give it the list of doctypes that we want to access offline. We have to put the PouchLink first, so it is reached first when we query the link chain : import CozyClient , { StackLink } from 'cozy-client' import PouchLink from 'cozy-pouch-link' const stackLink = new StackLink () const offlineDoctypes = [ 'io.cozy.todos' ] const pouchLink = new PouchLink ({ doctypes : offlineDoctypes , initialSync : true // whether you want to trigger the synchronization on login or not }) const client = new CozyClient ({ // ... links : [ pouchLink , stackLink ] }) The PouchLink will create the PouchDB databases for all offline doctypes and synchronize them with the distant CouchDB. All doctypes that are not managed by the PouchLink will be passed to the next link in the chain (in the previous example, the StackLink ).","title":"mobile-guide"},{"location":"/cozy-client/mobile-guide/#using-cozyclient-on-a-mobile-app","text":"","title":"Using CozyClient on a mobile app"},{"location":"/cozy-client/mobile-guide/#configuration","text":"On the web, the server pass the token and the domain to the page directly through template variables.

First, let\u2019s install it : # using npm npm install cozy-pouch-link # using yarn yarn add cozy-pouch-link Then, we will create a new instance of this link and give it the list of doctypes that we want to access offline. We have to put the PouchLink first, so it is reached first when we query the link chain : import CozyClient , { StackLink } from 'cozy-client' import PouchLink from 'cozy-pouch-link' const stackLink = new StackLink () const offlineDoctypes = [ 'io.cozy.todos' ] const pouchLink = new PouchLink ({ doctypes : offlineDoctypes , initialSync : true // whether you want to trigger the synchronization on login or not }) const client = new CozyClient ({ // ... links : [ pouchLink , stackLink ] }) The PouchLink will create the PouchDB databases for all offline doctypes and synchronize them with the distant CouchDB. All doctypes that are not managed by the PouchLink will be passed to the next link in the chain (in the previous example, the StackLink ).","title":"Support offline for some doctypes with cozy-pouch-link"},{"location":"/cozy-device-helper/CHANGELOG/","text":"Change Log \u00b6 All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

Targets webpack.target.browser.js webpack.target.mobile.js Miscellaneous webpack.vars.js Introduction \u00b6 To build a Cozy application, cozy-scripts uses webpack under the hood, and this documentation is dedicated to all webpack configuration files. In order to organize all these webpack configurations, they are classified in many files according to the concern. Having many unit files for the configuration will also allow to support specific application needs without \u2018ejecting\u2019 (removing cozy-scripts dependency and copy all webpack configurations and dependencies to the application repository). These files are supposed to be enoughly independant to be usable upon request as far as possible without conflicts. Kind of config file: \u00b6 Bundle: A bundle regroup many unit configuration for a specific use case like the default React application or an VueJS application. Environment: An environment config is in charge of provided variables and pluging specific to a compiling context (development or production for example). Target: A target means the one which will use the built. For now we only have to targets, browser for the default web application and mobile for the native mobile application using Cordova (in progress). Bundles \u00b6 webpack.bundle.default.js \u00b6 This file is the default config bundle used for the application built from cozy-scripts . It uses all following configs files: - webpack.config.base.js - webpack.config.chunks.js - webpack.config.cozy-ui.js - webpack.config.cozy-ui.react.js - webpack.config.eslint.js - webpack.config.intents.js - webpack.config.manifest.js - webpack.config.pictures.js - webpack.config.progress.js - webpack.config.react.js - webpack.config.vendors.js - webpack.environment.dev.js - webpack.environment.prod.js - webpack.target.browser.js - webpack.target.mobile.js - webpack.vars.js By default cozy-scripts uses this bundle in an opinionated way, but you can overload this configuration by creating a custom app.config.js in your application root directory: // app.config.js // using ES Modules import configs from 'cozy-scripts/config/webpack.bundle.default.js' import myConfig from './config/webpack.myconfig.js' // or using CommonJS const configs = require ( 'cozy-scripts/config/webpack.bundle.default.js' ) const myConfig = require ( './config/webpack.myconfig.js' ) // it's possible to add many custom configurations using this way, // the last will overwrite the previous in case of conflicts module . exports = [ configs , myConfig ] webpack.bundle.preact.js \u00b6 This file is the same default bundle but using preact instead (previous default config bundle used for the application built from cozy-scripts ). It uses all following configs files: - webpack.config.base.js - webpack.config.chunks.js - webpack.config.cozy-ui.js - webpack.config.cozy-ui.react.js - webpack.config.eslint.js - webpack.config.intents.js - webpack.config.manifest.js - webpack.config.pictures.js - webpack.config.preact.js - webpack.config.progress.js - webpack.config.vendors.js - webpack.environment.dev.js - webpack.environment.prod.js - webpack.target.browser.js - webpack.target.mobile.js - webpack.vars.js This config will replace react usage by preact-compat in a transparent manner (webpack aliases). The app.config.js is needed to use this bundle since it\u2019s not the default one for cozy-scripts . But you can still overload it using a custom config like the default bundle: // app.config.js // using ES Modules import configs from 'cozy-scripts/config/webpack.bundle.preact.js' import myConfig from './config/webpack.myconfig.js' // or using CommonJS const configs = require ( 'cozy-scripts/config/webpack.bundle.preact.js' ) const myConfig = require ( './config/webpack.myconfig.js' ) // it's possible to add many custom configurations using this way, // the last will overwrite the previous in case of conflicts module . exports = [ configs , myConfig ] webpack.bundle.vue.js \u00b6 This file is the VueJS config bundle used for the application built from cozy-scripts with the option --vue . It uses all following configs files: - webpack.config.base.js - webpack.config.chunks.js - webpack.config.cozy-ui.js - webpack.config.eslint.js - webpack.config.intents.js - webpack.config.manifest.js - webpack.config.pictures.js - webpack.config.progress.js - webpack.config.vendors.js - webpack.config.vue.js - webpack.environment.dev.js - webpack.environment.prod.js - webpack.target.browser.js - webpack.target.mobile.js - webpack.vars.js You can still overload it using a custom config like the default bundle using the app.config.js file: // app.config.js // ES Modules import configs from 'cozy-scripts/config/webpack.bundle.vue.js' import myConfig from './config/webpack.myconfig.js' // or CommonJS const configs = require ( 'cozy-scripts/config/webpack.bundle.vue.js' ) const myConfig = require ( './config/webpack.myconfig.js' ) // it's possible to add many custom configurations using this way, // the last will overwrite the previous in case of conflicts module . exports = [ configs , myConfig ] Unit Configs \u00b6 webpack.config.analyzer.js \u00b6 This file will only add the plugin webpack-bundle-analyzer to be run on with the --analyzer option. It will run a server (on port 8889 to not be in conflict with the webpack dev server) and open an interactive treemap visualization of the contents of all your bundles in your browser. webpack.config.base.js \u00b6 The default basic configuration of the application. Properties \u00b6 output to [name].js filename resolve: modules to ['node_modules', 'src'] extensions: .js , .json and .css Rules \u00b6 all .js (excluding node_modules , cozy-bar and cozy-client-js ) to be loaded using babel-loader (with cacheDirectory option for caching in node_modules/.cache/babel-loader ) all .css to be loaded using options: mini-css-extract-plugin extractor loader by default or style-loader for hot reloading css-loader with sourceMap postcss-loader to optimize css output code with sourceMap and autoprefixer plugin to { browsers: ['last 2 versions'] } A specific noParse property is enabled on /localforage/dist . Plugins: \u00b6 postcss-assets-webpack-plugin (logs from this plugin are shown only in --debug mode) to load all .css files with: css-mqpacker (pack all CSS media query rules into one) postcss-discard-duplicates (remove duplicates) postcss-discard-empty (remove empty definitions) csswring only in production environment to minify and remove comments ( preservehacks enabled) webpack.config.chunks.js \u00b6 This configuration will use the optimization property with splitChunks in order to split the build into two chunks: - The main one, it can be app or intents - And the vendors chunk which will gather all stuff from node_modules Splitting chunks allow to decrease the size of the main chunk and optimize the build for caching (mainly the main chunk will change during development). webpack.config.cozy-ui.js \u00b6 This configuration will allow to load styles from cozy-ui . It adds a rule for all .styl files excluding node_modules and node_modules/cozy-ui/react to be loaded using: - mini-css-extract-plugin extractor loader by default or style-loader for hot reloading - css-loader with sourceMap - postcss-loader to optimize css output code with sourceMap and autoprefixer plugin to { browsers: ['last 2 versions'] } - stylus-loader using the custom stylus plugin from cozy-ui as option It also uses svg-sprite-loader/plugin to merge the built svg sprite from cozy-ui into the application\u2019s one webpack.config.cozy-ui.react.js \u00b6 This configuration is specific to react components usage from cozy-ui , since they currently need css-modules . This configuration file could be removed if this cozy-ui requirement disappear. It adds a rule for all .styl files from cozy-ui/react to be loaded using: - mini-css-extract-plugin extractor loader by default or style-loader for hot reloading - css-loader with modules , sourceMap and [local]--[hash:base64:5] as localIdentName - postcss-loader to optimize css output code with sourceMap and autoprefixer plugin to { browsers: ['last 2 versions'] } - stylus-loader using the custom stylus plugin from cozy-ui as option webpack.config.css-modules.js \u00b6 This configuration will allow to use css-modules with stylus files. To overload previous stylus loaders, it uses the following webpack-merge smartStrategy : { 'modules.loaders': 'replace' } . It adds a rule for all .styl files excluding node_modules and node_modules/cozy-ui/react to be loaded using: - mini-css-extract-plugin extractor loader by default or style-loader for hot reloading - css-loader with modules , sourceMap and [local]--[hash:base64:5] as localIdentName - postcss-loader to optimize css output code with sourceMap and autoprefixer plugin to { browsers: ['last 2 versions'] } - stylus-loader webpack.config.eslint.js \u00b6 A rule to preload all .js/.jsx files with eslint-loader (excluding node_modules ) extending babel-preset-cozy-app The emitWarning option is set to true for production environment or if hot reload is enabled to force emitting warning and to avoid errors breaking the build. webpack.config.intents.js \u00b6 This is a specific configuration file to develop application intents for the Cozy platform. It will: - add a webpack entry: the babel-polyfill import and the src/targets/intents/intents.jsx file - use html-webpack-plugin configured to use index.ejs HTML template from src/targets/intents/ with options: - title : name property of the package.json + intents - filename : intents/index.html , the output file - excludeChunks : to exclude chunk app - inject to false - minify with collapseWhitespace to true webpack.config.hash.js \u00b6 A custom webpack plugin usage to extract the hash from built files for reference. webpack.config.manifest.js \u00b6 A copy-webpack-plugin plugin usage to copy the manifest.webapp , README.md and LICENSE files to the output build folder. In the production environment, the manifest.webapp is transformed to include locales from the application src/locales folder (locales concerning manifest descriptions, permissions, names\u2026). It will look for the manifest property (if found) of the locale .json file. So the locales property of the manifest.webapp will be an object of language slugs as properties and each slug matching the related locales found. The langs array in the manifest will also be computed according to the languages found in src/locales . Except for production environment, the manifest.webapp is transformed using a custom function to change the slug property value to app (to keep using app.cozy.tools:8080 URL for different app development). webpack.config.pictures.js \u00b6 This configuration will handle all pictures files. It will add two rules: - all .svg files in sprites/ and icons/ folders will be loaded using svg-sprite-loader with output name to [name]_[hash] . This loader will merge all SVG content to one .svg file and replace their reference to the matching id . Only one .svg sprite file will be loaded by the ouput application. - all other .svg , .png , .gif , .jpg , .jpeg files will be loaded using file-loader with options: - path to img , the ouput folder - symbolId to [name].[hash].[ext] for production environment, [name].[ext] for other environments It also adds svg-sprite-loader/plugin as plugin to use it with the related loader. webpack.config.preact.js \u00b6 A config to resolve all react aliases using Preact instead. It will: - resolve .jsx extensions - add aliases: - react to preact-compat - react-dom to preact-compat - Due to an HMR issue , preact-compat to preact-compat/dist/preact-compat - add a rule for .jsx files excluding node_modules (exception for node_modules/cozy-ui ) to be loaded using babel-loader (with cacheDirectory option for caching in node_modules/.cache/babel-loader ) webpack.config.progress.js \u00b6 This config will just add a custom webpack plugin to display a progress bar when webpack building/watching. It internally uses the included webpack plugin webpack.ProgressPlugin . webpack.config.services.js \u00b6 This config will provide a separate config to build app services using Webpack multi-compiling . In this case, all services files ( .js files in the /src/targets/services/ folder) will be built using this separate webpack config. This config will: - use __mergeStrategy to drive the webpack-merge strategy : - disable smart merging - use the replace mode plugins , output , entry , optimization and module - define as webpack entry an array of all .js files contained in /src/target/services folder - use as output the /build/services folder with [name].js as filename - define the target as 'node' - disable devtool (boolean to false ) - define the global variable __TARGET__ to services using the plugin webpack.DefinePlugin This config will be used only if the webpack target is browser . webpack.config.react.js \u00b6 A config to load .jsx using for React components. It will: - resolve .jsx extensions - add a rule for .jsx files excluding node_modules (exception for node_modules/cozy-ui ) to be loaded using babel-loader (with cacheDirectory option for caching in node_modules/.cache/babel-loader ) webpack.config.vendors.js \u00b6 A copy-webpack-plugin plugin usage to copy all files from the vendors/assets/ folder to the output build folder. This config will also process the application icon and run svgo to optimize it if this is a SVG file. webpack.config.vue.js \u00b6 A config to use the VueJS (v2+) framework. It will: - resolve .vue extensions - add a rule for .vue files, excluding node_modules , to be loaded using vue-loader . Environments \u00b6 webpack.environment.dev.js \u00b6 Properties \u00b6 devtool to #source-map externals with ['cozy'] to exclude all cozy.* dependencies from the output bundle (since it will be serve by ProvidePlugin ) mode to development Plugins: \u00b6 webpack.DefinePlugin to define globals variables at compiling time: __DEVELOPMENT__ to true __STACK_ASSETS__ to false webpack.ProvidePlugin to provide cozy-bar and cozy-client-js from node_modules (in production, these modules will be provided to the application by the cozy-stack ) Copy ( copy-webpack-plugin ) the cozy-bar.css file from node_modules ot the app build to be able to develop on the cozy-bar using the app Add the cozy-bar css to the main html file via html-webpack-include-assets-plugin Only in the hot reload mode: - webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin which allows all kinds of modules to be updated at runtime without the need for a full refresh - write-file-webpack-plugin to write all the build file from webpack-dev-server to the disk (necessary for the hot-reloading) webpack.environment.prod.js \u00b6 Plugins: \u00b6 webpack.optimize.OccurrenceOrderPlugin webpack.DefinePlugin to define globals variables at compiling time: process.env.NODE_ENV to production __DEVELOPMENT__ to false __DEVTOOLS__ to false __STACK_ASSETS__ to true if target different from mobile In this production mode, webpack will automatically use the Terser plugin to optimize the build (with parallel: true to speedup the build).

They are necessary to build correctly the application. It will export these following variables: - addAnalyzer according to the COZY_SCRIPTS_ANALYZER environment variable (used to get the webpack-bundle-analyze usage) - environment according to NODE_ENV environment variable ( target:environment ) - getCSSLoader , a function returing the correctly style lodaer to use ( mini-css-extract-plugin loader by default and style-loader for hot reloading) - isDebugMode according to the COZY_SCRIPTS_DEBUG environment variable (used to get into a debug mode of cozy-scripts ) - target according to NODE_ENV environment variable ( target:environment ) - useHotReload according to the HOT_RELOAD environment variable to use hot reloading feature or not If no environment variable NODE_ENV is found, it will be browser:development by default.","title":"webpack-configs"},{"location":"/cozy-scripts/webpack-configs/#the-cozy-scripts-webpack-configurations","text":"","title":"The cozy-scripts Webpack configurations"},{"location":"/cozy-scripts/webpack-configs/#table-of-content","text":"Introduction Bundles webpack.bundle.default.js webpack.bundle.preact.js webpack.bundle.vue.js Unit Configs webpack.config.analyzer.js webpack.config.base.js webpack.config.chunks.js webpack.config.cozy-ui.js webpack.config.cozy-ui.react.js webpack.config.css-modules.js webpack.config.eslint.js webpack.config.hash.js webpack.config.intents.js webpack.config.manifest.js webpack.config.pictures.js webpack.config.preact.js webpack.config.progress.js webpack.config.react.js webpack.config.services.js webpack.config.vendors.js webpack.config.vue.js Environments webpack.environment.dev.js webpack.environment.prod.js Targets webpack.target.browser.js webpack.target.mobile.js Miscellaneous webpack.vars.js","title":"Table of content"},{"location":"/cozy-scripts/webpack-configs/#introduction","text":"To build a Cozy application, cozy-scripts uses webpack under the hood, and this documentation is dedicated to all webpack configuration files.

Cozy Stack Architecture \u00b6 What is Cozy? \u00b6 Cozy is a personal platform as a service with a focus on data. Cozy can be seen as 4 layers, from inside to outside: A place to keep your personal data A core API to handle the data Your web apps, and also the mobile & desktop clients A coherent User Experience. It\u2019s also a set of values: Simple, Versatile, Yours. These values mean a lot for Cozy in all aspects. From an architectural point of view, it declines to: Simple to deploy and understand, not built as a galaxy of optimized microservices managed by kubernetes that only experts can debug. Versatile, can be hosted on a Raspberry Pi for geeks to massive scale on multiple servers by specialized hosting. Users can install apps. Yours, you own your data and you control it. If you want to take back your data to go elsewhere, you can. Overview \u00b6 The architecture of Cozy is composed of: A reverse proxy The cozy stack A CouchDB instance to persist the JSON documents A space for storing files Optionally, Redis for caching and synchronization Optionally, a metrics server. All of this can run on a personal server, self-hosted at home, like a Raspberry Pi: But it\u2019s also possible to deploy a cozy on a more powerful server in order to host dozens of cozy instances (an association for example). It will looks like this: And even to scale to thousands of cozy instances on a server farm, with high availability: This elasticity comes with some constraints: Most applications are run in the browser, not in the server. What must run on the server is mutualized inside the cozy stack. The cozy stack is stateless. The data is stored in couchdb and a space for files. A couchdb database is specific to an instance (no mix of data from 2 users in the same database). Reverse proxy \u00b6 The reverse proxy is here to accept HTTPS connexions and forward the request to the cozy stack. It\u2019s here mainly to manage the TLS part and binding a port < 1024 without needing to launch the cozy stack as root. And it\u2019s better if http/2 is supported, as it will make the web interface to load faster. The Cozy Stack \u00b6 The Cozy Stack is a single executable. It can do several things but its most important usage is starting an HTTP server to serve as an API for all the services of Cozy, from authentication to real-time events. This API can be used on several domains. Each domain is a cozy instance for a specific user (\u201cmulti-tenant\u201d). Redis \u00b6 Redis is optional when there is a single cozy stack running. When available, it is used to synchronize the Cozy Stacks: distributed locks for special operations like installing an application, queues for recurrent jobs, etc. As a bonus, it can also be used to cache some frequently used documents. Databases \u00b6 The JSON documents that represent the users data are stored in CouchDB, but they are not mixed in a single database. We don\u2019t mix data from 2 users in the same database. It\u2019s easier and safer to control the access to the data by using different databases per user. But we think to go even further by splitting the data of a user in several databases, one per document type. For example, we can have a database for the emails of a user and one for her todo list. This can simplify the implementation of permissions (this app has access to these document types) and can improve performance. CouchDB queries work with views. A view is defined ahead of its usage and is built by CouchDB when it is requested and is stale, i.e. there were writes in the database since the last time it was updated. So, with a single database per user, it\u2019s possible to experience lag when the todolist view is requested after fetching a long list of emails. By splitting the databases per doctypes, we gain on two fronts: The views are updated less frequently, only when documents of the matching doctypes are written. Some views are no longer necessary: those to access documents of a specific doctypes. There are downsides, mostly: It can be harder to manage more databases. It\u2019s no longer possible to use a single view for documents from doctypes that are no longer in the same database. We think that we can work on that and the pros will outweigh the cons. Metrics \u00b6 The Cozy Stack can generate some metrics about its usage (the size of the files transfered, the number of opened connexions, the number of requests to redis, etc.) and export them to a metrics backend. It will help identify the bottlenecks when scaling to add more users. The Warp 10 Platform looks like a good candidate for this. Glossary \u00b6 Instance \u00b6 An instance is a logical space owned by a user and identified by a domain. For example, zoe.cozycloud.cc can be the cozy instance of Zo\u00e9. This instance has a space for storing files and some CouchDB databases for storing the documents of its owner. Environment \u00b6 When creating an instance, it\u2019s possible to give an environment, dev , test or prod . The default apps won\u2019t be the same on all environments. For example, in the dev environment, some devtools will be installed to help the front developers to create their own apps. Cozy Stack Build Mode \u00b6 The cozy stack can run in several modes, set by a UNIX environment variable: production , the default development , for coding on the cozy stack. This mode is set when compiling the cozy-stack. It is used to show more or less logs, and what is acceptable to be displayed in errors. Even if the Cozy Stack Build Mode and Environment have similar values, they are not the same. The Cozy Stack Mode will be used by core developers to hack on the cozy stack. The environment will be used by front developers to hack on cozy apps. Services \u00b6 The cozy stack came with several services. They run on the server, inside the golang process and have an HTTP interface. Authentication /auth \u00b6 The cozy stack can authenticate the owner of a cozy instance. This can happen in the classical web style, with a form and a cookie, but also with OAuth2 for remote interactions like cozy-mobile and cozy-desktop. Applications /apps \u00b6 It\u2019s possible to manage serverless applications from the cozy stack and serve them via cozy stack. The stack does the routing and serve the HTML and the assets for the applications. The assets of the applications are installed in the virtual file system. On the big instances, it means that even if it is the frontal 1 that installs the application, frontal 2 will still be able to serve the application by getting its assets from Swift. It will be possible to install applications from several sources (git, mercurial, npm or even just a tarball). Also, we want to offer two channels for our official apps: one with a stable and well tested release, and one with more frequent updates for our more adventurous users. More informations here . Data System /data \u00b6 CouchDB is used for persistence of JSON documents. The data service is a layer on top of it for routing the requests to the corresponding CouchDB database and checking the permissions. In particular, a serverless application can declare some contexts and access data in those contexts even if it\u2019s not the owner of the cozy instance that access it. For example, the owner of a cozy can create a photo album with a selection of photos. This album can then be associated to a context to be shared with friends of the owner. These friends can access the album and see the photos, but not anonymous people. More informations here . Virtual File System /files \u00b6 It\u2019s possible to store files on the cozy, including binary ones like photos and movies, thanks to the virtual file system. It\u2019s a facade, with several implementations, depending on where the files are effectively stored: In a directory of a local file system (easier for self-hosted users) Swift from Open Stack (convenient for massive hosting) And more storage providers, like minio , later. The range of possible operations with this endpoint goes from simple ones, like uploading a file, to more complex ones, like renaming a folder. It also ensure that an instance is not exceeding its quota, and keeps a trash to recover files recently deleted. More informations here . Sharing /sharings \u00b6 Users will want to share things like calendars. This service is there for sharing JSON documents between cozy instances, with respect to the access control. Jobs /jobs \u00b6 The cozy stack has queues where job descriptions can be put. For example, a job can be to fetch the latest bills from a specific provider. These queues can be consumed by external workers to complete the associated jobs. We can imagine having a media worker that extract thumbnails from photos and videos. It will fetch jobs from a media queue and each job description will contain the path to the photo or video from which the thumbnail will be extracted. There is also a scheduler that acts like a crontab. It can add jobs at recurrent time. For example, it can add a job for fetching github commits every hour. Later, we can dream about having more ways to create jobs (webhooks, on document creation) and make them communicate. With a web interface on that, it can become a simplified Ifttt . Sync /sync \u00b6 This endpoint will be for synchronizing your contacts and calendars by using standard methods like caldav and carddav. Later, we hope to support also Webdav and RemoteStorage. Settings /settings \u00b6 Each cozy instance has some settings, like its domain name, its language, the name of its owner, the background for the home, etc. Notifications /notifications \u00b6 The applications can put some notifications for the user. That goes from a reminder for a meeting in 10 minutes to a suggestion to update your app. Real-time /realtime \u00b6 This endpoint can be used to subscribe for real-time events. An application that shows items of a specific doctype can listen for this doctype to be notified of all the changes for this doctype. For example, the calendar app can listen for all the events and if a synchronization with the mobile adds a new event, the app will be notified and can show this new event. Error catcher /errors \u00b6 Client-side applications can have some JS errors. By sending the error, with its backtrace, to this endpoint, it will be kept in a logfile to help the developers debug the application later. We should look at the airbrake API and probably be compatible with it to avoid redeveloping JS code to send the errors. Proxy /proxy \u00b6 It can be useful for client-side apps to get data from public APIs. But, sometimes, these APIs don\u2019t have CORS enabled. A proxy endpoint can be a simple but effective solution for these cases. Status /status \u00b6 It\u2019s here just to say that the API is up and that it can access the CouchDB databases, for debugging and monitoring purposes. Workers \u00b6 The workers take jobs from the queues and process them. Fetch emails /jobs/mailbox \u00b6 It fetches a mailbox to synchronize it and see if there are some new emails. Payload: the mailbox Send email /jobs/sendmail \u00b6 It connects to the SMTP server to send an email. Payload: mail account, recipient, body, attachments Extract metadata /jobs/metadata \u00b6 When a file is added or updated, this worker will extract its metadata (EXIF for an image, id3 for a music, etc.) Payload: the filepath Konnectors /jobs/konnector \u00b6 It synchronizes an account on a remote service (fetch bills for example). Payload: the kind of konnector, the credentials of the account and some optional parameters (like the folder where to put the files) Registry /jobs/registry \u00b6 It updates the list of available applications. Payload: none Indexer /jobs/indexer \u00b6 When a JSON document is added, updated or deleted, this worker will update the index for full text search. Bleve looks like a good candidate for the indexing and full text search technology. Payload: the doctype and the document to index Serverless apps \u00b6 Home /apps/home \u00b6 It\u2019s where you land on your cozy and launch your apps. Having widgets to display informations would be nice too! Store (was marketplace) /apps/store \u00b6 You can install new apps here. Settings (was My apps) /apps/settings \u00b6 It\u2019s a list of your installed apps and devices, and you can configure some settings like your email address. Collect (was konnectors) /apps/collect \u00b6 You can configure new accounts, to fetch data from them, and see the already configured accounts. Devtools /apps/devtools \u00b6 Some tools for the developpers of applications only: an API console, documentation, logs of the permission checks, etc. Contacts /apps/contacts \u00b6 Manage your contact books. Calendar /apps/calendar \u00b6 Manage your events and alarms. Drive /apps/drive \u00b6 A web interface to browse your files. Photos /apps/photos \u00b6 Organize your photos and share them with friends. Todo list /apps/todo \u00b6 A task manager to never forgot what you should do. Onboarding /apps/onboarding \u00b6 Start your cozy and setup your accounts. Clients \u00b6 Mobile \u00b6 Cozy-mobile is an application for android and iOS for synchronizing files, contacts and calendars between the phone and the cozy instance. Desktop \u00b6 Cozy-desktop is a client for Linux, OSX and windows that allows to sync the files in a cozy instance with a laptop or desktop. Guidelines \u00b6 The Go Programming Language \u00b6 Go (often referred as golang) is an open source programming language created at Google in 2007. It has nice properties for our usage: Simplicity (the language can be learned in weeks, not years). A focus on productivity. Good performance. A good support of concurrency with channels and goroutines. Moreover, Go is used by a lot of companies , is in the Top 10 of the most used languages and has some known open source projects: docker, kubernetes, grafana, syncthing, influxdb, caddy, etc. And it works on the ARM platforms . Go has some tools to help the developers to format its code ( go fmt ), retrieve and install external packages ( go get ), display documentation ( godoc ), check for potential errors with static analysis ( go vet ), etc. Most of them can be used via gometalinter , which is nice for continuous integration. So, we think that writing the Cozy Stack in Go is the right choice. Repository organisation \u00b6 \u251c\u2500\u2500 assets The assets for the front-end \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 images The images \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts The javascript files \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 styles The CSS files \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 templates The HTML templates \u251c\u2500\u2500 cmd One .go file for each command of the cozy executable \u251c\u2500\u2500 docs Documentation, including this file \u251c\u2500\u2500 pkg One sub-directory for each golang package \u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts Some shell scripts for developers and testing \u2514\u2500\u2500 web One sub-directory for each of the services listed above Rest API \u00b6 We follow the best practices about Rest API (using the right status codes, HTTP verbs, organise code by resources, use content-negociation, etc.). When known standards make sense (caldav & carddav for example), use them. Else, JSON API is a good default. The golang web framework used for the cozy stack is Echo . HTTP status codes \u00b6 There are some HTTP status codes that are generally used in the API: 200 OK, when everything is OK 201 Created, when a resource was created 204 No Content, when a resource was deleted 400 Bad Request, when the request has some unknown parameters and the request body is not in the expected format 401 Unauthorized, when the user is not authenticated 403 Forbidden, when the permissions forbid this action 404 Not Found, when the resouce can\u2019t be found 500 Internal Server Error, when a bug occurs 503 Service Unavailable, when the stack, CouchDB, Redis or Swift is unavailable. DocTypes \u00b6 Each JSON document saved in CouchDB has a field docType that identify the kind of thing it is. For example, a contact will have the docType io.cozy.contacts , and in the cozy-doctypes repository, there will be a contacts JSON file inside it that describes this doctype: What are the mandatory and optional fields? What is the type (string, integer, date) of the fields? Is there a validation rule for a field? How the fields can be indexed for full text search? What is the role of each field (documentation)? This description can be used by any cozy client library (JS, Golang, etc.) to generate some models to simplify the use of documents of this doctype. When a docType has a lot of logic (calendar events for example), a JS class should be shared between the several client-side apps that use this docType, in order to avoid recoding this logic in each application. Import and export \u00b6 You will stay because you can leave. An important promise of Cozy is to give back to the users the control of their data. And this promise is not complete with a way to export the data to use it somewhere else. The Cozy Stack will offer an export button that gives a tarball to the user with the full data. She can then import it on another instance for example. It should also be possible to use the data outside of Cozy. So, the format for the tarball should be as simple as possible and be documented. Of course, when it\u2019s possible, we will use open formats. How to contribute? \u00b6 Cozy\u2019s DNA is fundamentally Open Source and we want our community to thrive. Having contributions (code, design, translations) is important for us and we will try to create the favorable conditions to support it. Adding a new konnector \u00b6 Adding a konnector is easy for someone who knows JavaScript. The repository has already a lot of pull requests by external contributors. The wiki has documentation to explain the first steps of creating a new konnector. 3 active contributors have been promoted to the maintainers team and can merge the pull requests. We have done workshops to help new developers code their first konnector and we will keep doing it. Creating a new application \u00b6 One of the goals of the new architecture is to make it easier for developers to write new apps. It means having a good documentation, but also some devtools to help: The cozy executable will have a command to setup a new project. The devtools on the cozy interface will give documentation about the doctypes, help explore the Rest API, and check if the permissions are OK. cozy-ui will make it easy to reuse some widgets and offer an application with a style coherent to the cozy identity. Some docTypes with heavy logic will be available as JS classes to be reused in the apps. Reporting a bug or suggesting a new feature \u00b6 We are listening to our users. The forum is here to discuss on many subjects, including how the applications are used. The issues on github are a good place for bug tracking. Translating to a new language \u00b6 We will keep having internationalization for our applications and the translations are maintained on transifex by the community. Translating to a new language, or reviewing an existing one, is really appreciated. FAQ \u00b6 Does the current konnectors in nodejs will be lost? No, they won\u2019t. The business logic to scrap data from the many sources will be kept and they will be adapted to fit in this new architecture. It is explained how we will do that here . So, it\u2019s not possible to have a custom application with a server part, like the lounge IRC client? We want to support this use case, just not on the short term. It\u2019s not clear how we can do that (while not weakening the security). One idea is to run the applications in a different server, or maybe in docker. How to install and update cozy? The Cozy Stack will have no auto-update mechanism. For installing and updating it, you can use the classical ways: Using a package manager, like apt for debian & ubuntu. Using an official image for Raspberry Pi (and other embedded platforms). Using the image and services of an hosting company. Or compiling and installing it manually if you are really brave ;-) How to add a cozy instance to a farm? Choose a (sub-)domain and configure the DNS for this (sub-)domain. Configure the reverse-proxy to accept this (sub-)domain. Use the cozy executable to configure the cozy stack. How to migrate from the nodejs cozy to this new architecture for cozy? Export the data from the nodejs cozy (we need to add a button in the web interface for that in the coming months). Install the new cozy. Import the data. Please note that we don\u2019t support a continuous replication method that will enable to use both the nodejs and the new architecture at the same time. It looks too complicated for a temporary thing. How to backup the data? There are 2 sensitive places with data: In CouchDB. on the place used for the Virtual File System (a directory on the local filesystem, or in Swift). You can use the tools of your choice to backup these 2 locations. The good old rsync works fine (CouchDB files are append-only, except when compaction happens, so it\u2019s friendly to rsync). It\u2019s highly recommended to have an automated backup, but sometimes it can be useful to have a way to backup manually the data. The \u201cexport data\u201d button in the web interface give a tarball that can be used to transfer your data from one instance to another, and so, it can be used as a backup. Aren\u2019t microservices better for scaling? Yes, it\u2019s often easier to scale by separating concerns, and microservices is a way to achieve that. But, it has some serious downsides: It takes more memory and it\u2019s probably a no-go for Raspberry Pi. It\u2019s more complicated for a developper to install the whole stack before coding its application. It\u2019s harder to deploy in production. For the scalability, we can also deploy some specialized instances of the Cozy Stack. For example, we can have some Cozy Stack processes dedicated for real-time. Even, if they have all the code, we can route only the relevant trafic from the load-balancer. What are the frameworks and tools used for the front-end apps? If you want to develop your own app, you can use the framework and the tools you like, nothing is mandatory. For the official apps, we will want to move to: es2017 (but converting the existing coffeescript code will take time) npm scripts and webpack preact & JSX. More about this here When will this new architecture be available?

No, they won\u2019t. The business logic to scrap data from the many sources will be kept and they will be adapted to fit in this new architecture. It is explained how we will do that here . So, it\u2019s not possible to have a custom application with a server part, like the lounge IRC client? We want to support this use case, just not on the short term. It\u2019s not clear how we can do that (while not weakening the security). One idea is to run the applications in a different server, or maybe in docker. How to install and update cozy? The Cozy Stack will have no auto-update mechanism. For installing and updating it, you can use the classical ways: Using a package manager, like apt for debian & ubuntu. Using an official image for Raspberry Pi (and other embedded platforms). Using the image and services of an hosting company. Or compiling and installing it manually if you are really brave ;-) How to add a cozy instance to a farm? Choose a (sub-)domain and configure the DNS for this (sub-)domain. Configure the reverse-proxy to accept this (sub-)domain. Use the cozy executable to configure the cozy stack. How to migrate from the nodejs cozy to this new architecture for cozy? Export the data from the nodejs cozy (we need to add a button in the web interface for that in the coming months). Install the new cozy. Import the data. Please note that we don\u2019t support a continuous replication method that will enable to use both the nodejs and the new architecture at the same time. It looks too complicated for a temporary thing. How to backup the data? There are 2 sensitive places with data: In CouchDB. on the place used for the Virtual File System (a directory on the local filesystem, or in Swift). You can use the tools of your choice to backup these 2 locations. The good old rsync works fine (CouchDB files are append-only, except when compaction happens, so it\u2019s friendly to rsync). It\u2019s highly recommended to have an automated backup, but sometimes it can be useful to have a way to backup manually the data. The \u201cexport data\u201d button in the web interface give a tarball that can be used to transfer your data from one instance to another, and so, it can be used as a backup. Aren\u2019t microservices better for scaling? Yes, it\u2019s often easier to scale by separating concerns, and microservices is a way to achieve that. But, it has some serious downsides: It takes more memory and it\u2019s probably a no-go for Raspberry Pi. It\u2019s more complicated for a developper to install the whole stack before coding its application. It\u2019s harder to deploy in production. For the scalability, we can also deploy some specialized instances of the Cozy Stack. For example, we can have some Cozy Stack processes dedicated for real-time. Even, if they have all the code, we can route only the relevant trafic from the load-balancer. What are the frameworks and tools used for the front-end apps? If you want to develop your own app, you can use the framework and the tools you like, nothing is mandatory. For the official apps, we will want to move to: es2017 (but converting the existing coffeescript code will take time) npm scripts and webpack preact & JSX.

Number of unactive users must not impact perfs too much. Note : definition of active user TBD (mobile app and 3rd party software are syncing using *dav and some background jobs like fetching banks accounts and threshold alerts ) HTTPS between stack and couchdb is not a priority. If it\u2019s an option, it will allow more flexibility for ops team, but we can always find alternative solution to secure channel between stack and couchdb and self-hosted users will probably have both on an single machine.

We will probably do some kind of polling, this will need to be investigated deeper. Binaries will NOT be stored in couchdb. We will only store in couchdb reference to the file in another storage solution (FS / Swift) The stack will use couchdb in 2 ways : Just proxying to/from the client, we will still need to parse the JSON, but will only read or changes a few special fields ( _id , _type , _tags ....) for ACL and then pipe it to/from couchdb. We wont need to make sense of the whole document and can eventually get away without parsing it on some routes. This part should be totally flexible on the json content. Some APIs and Jobs will need to make sense of the given documents, so (un)marshal them from/into smarter struct (CalendarEvent) to be used in business logic. Analysis \u00b6 They are all relatively similar in term of API. rhinoman has some more functions that we will need but lack changes feed. They all have a struct for database which hold configuration, as most of our request will be on different databases, we will have a great churn for these structure. This is less than optimal for RAM & GC, but probably insignificant against JSON parsing. They all use JSON Marshal et encode to accept any interface{} as couchdb doc. They are all relatively inactive / stable, not sure if it is because they are \u201cfinished\u201d or abandonware. No library has a notion of pooling connection. This is handled at the net/http.Transport level in golang. Only the first library has option for fine-tunning of the internal Client/Transport, No library support couchdb2 mango Going further (thanks @tomquest) \u00b6 Another advantage of a DIY solution: building exactly what stack needs. This is orienting the CouchDB access code for Cozy usage. And this could be implemented as a DSL . For example: (if I understand the architecture, the goal is for an User to have many Databases, one for each DocumentType) // Create an Email couchdb . Doc ( anEmail ) // deduce the database from the type of the parameters . Create () // .Update() // .Delete() // List emails from 100 to 200 emails = couchdb . emails () // pick the appropriate database . Offset ( 100 ) . Limit ( 200 ) . Order ( DATE , DESC ) . select () // Create the adhoc CouchDb query (`Mango` style ?) BTW, couchdb could be an already configured object with the appropriate user credentials. Pros: Cozy-stack oriented (functionally) Still able to access CouchDb natively (eg. couchdb.Connection() ) Can hide technical stuff: access to the pool, concurrency, caching, https, retries, timeouts\u2026 Build and maintained by Cozy Cons: DSL to write (and testing is a bit harder) To be maintained, but in fact, this is already the case for the other wrappers Current decision \u00b6 We will make our own driver by cherry picking relevant codes in other libraries.","title":"couchdb-plugins"},{"location":"/cozy-stack/archives/couchdb-plugins/#couchdb-plugins-analysis","text":"(original discussion is at https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack/issues/9)","title":"Couchdb plugins analysis"},{"location":"/cozy-stack/archives/couchdb-plugins/#existing-packages","text":"","title":"Existing packages"},{"location":"/cozy-stack/archives/couchdb-plugins/#httpsgithubcomtimjacobigo-couchdb","text":"last edit 2016-08 Apparently one of the firsts Includes a http module, trying to figure out why, might simply be history (started in 2014) fork of the \u201coriginal\u201d https://github.com/fjl/go-couchdb brother of https://github.com/pokstad/go-couchdb which is used in this cool article : http://pokstad.com/2015/04/18/couchdb-and-go.html Have tools to run as couchdbapp / couchdbdaemon (we wont use these) Allow to pass a net/http.RoundTripper for fine transport tunning.

Konnectors \u00b6 :warning: Note: this documentation is outdated. It is kept for historical reasons and shows the design and trade-offs we have made initially. But a lot of things have changed since, so don\u2019t expect the things to be still the same. What we want ? \u00b6 Konnectors is an application for Cozy v2 that fetch data from different web sites and services, and save them into a Cozy. The 50+ connectors represent a lot of work from the community. So, we want to port it to Cozy v3. There will be 2 parts: My Accounts, a client-side app, that will offer the possibility for the user to configure her accounts, and choose when to start the import of data (see the architecture doc ). Konnectors, a worker for the job service , with the code to import data from the web sites. Security \u00b6 The risks \u00b6 Konnectors is not just a random application. It\u2019s a very good target for attacks on Cozy because of these specificities: It run on the server, where there is no Content Security Policy, or firewall to protect the stack. It has access to Internet, by design. It is written in nodejs, with a lot of dependencies where it is easy to hide malicious code. It is a collection of connectors written by a lot of people. We welcome these contributions, but it also means that we take into account that we can\u2019t review in depth all the contributions. Access to couchdb \u00b6 The stack has the admin credentials of couchdb. If a rogue code can read its configuration file or intercept connexions between the stack and couchdb, it will have access to couchdb with the admin credentials, and can do anything on couchdb. Access to the stack \u00b6 An attacker can try to profit of konnectors for accessing the stack. It can target the port 6060, used by the stack to manage the cozy instances. Or, it can use its privileged position for timing attacks on passwords. Spying other connectors \u00b6 A rogue connector may try to spy other connectors to pick the credentials for external web sites. It can be done by reading the environment variables or ptracing them. DoS \u00b6 A connector can use a lot of CPU, Ram, or generate a lot of disk I/O to make a deny of service on the server. The connector can remove files on the server to make konnectors stop working. Exploiting the CPU or the bandwidth \u00b6 The resources of the server can be seen as valuable: the CPU can be used for bitcoins mining. The bandwidth can be used for DDoS of an external target. Sending spam \u00b6 Profit of the configured SMTP server to send spams. Be root \u00b6 Row hammer can be a way to gain root access on a server. Possible measures \u00b6 Permissions \u00b6 We can forbid the konnectors to speak directly with couchdb, and pass by the stack for that. And use the permissions to restrict what each konnectors can do with the cozy-stack. ignore-scripts for npm/yarn \u00b6 Npm and yarn can execute scripts defined in package.json when installing nodejs dependencies. We can use the ignore-scripts option to disable this behaviour. Forbid addons in nodejs \u00b6 Nodejs can require addons , ie C/C++ compiled libraries. I\u2019ve found no flag to disable the install of such modules for npm/yarn, and no flag for nodejs to prevent loading them. We can try to detect and remove such modules just after the installation of node modules. They should have a .node extension. Note : not having a compiler on the server is not enough. Npm can install precompiled modules. vm/sandbox for Nodejs \u00b6 vm2 is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with whitelisted Node\u2019s built-in modules. Mock net \u00b6 We can mock the net module of nodejs to add some restrictions on what it can do. For example, we can check that it does only http/https, and blacklist connection to localhost:6060. It is only effective if the konnector has no way to start a new node processus. Timeout \u00b6 If a konnector takes too long, after a timeout, it should be killed. It implies that the cozy-stacks supervises the konnectors. Chroot \u00b6 Chroot is a UNIX syscall that makes an application see only a part of the file-system. In particular, we can remove access to /proc and /sys by not mounting them, and limit access to /dev to just /dev/null , /dev/zero , and /dev/random by symlinks them. Executing as another user \u00b6 We can create UNIX users that will just serve to execute the konnectors, and nothing else. It\u2019s a nice way to give more isolation, but it means that we have to find a way to execute the konnectors: either run the cozy-stack as root, or have a daemon that launches the konnectors. Ulimit & Prlimit \u00b6 ulimit provides control over the resources available to the shell and to processes started by it, on systems that allow such control. It can be used to linit the number of processes (protection against fork bombs), or the memory that can be used. prlimit can do the same for just one command (technically, for a new session, not the current one). Linux namespaces \u00b6 One feature Linux provides here is namespaces. There are a bunch of different kinds: in a pid namespace you become PID 1 and then your children are other processes. All the other programs are gone in a networking namespace you can run programs on any port you want without it conflicting with what\u2019s already running in a mount namespace you can mount and unmount filesystems without it affecting the host filesystem. So you can have a totally different set of devices mounted (usually less). It turns out that making namespaces is totally easy! You can just run a program called unshare . Source: What even is a container, by Julia Evans Cgroups \u00b6 cgroups (abbreviated from control groups) is a Linux kernel feature that limits, accounts for, and isolates the resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, etc.) of a collection of processes. Seccomp BPF \u00b6 Seccomp BPF is an extension to seccomp that allows filtering of system calls using a configurable policy implemented using Berkeley Packet Filter rules. Isolation in a docker \u00b6 Isode is a 3 years old project that aims to isolate nodejs apps in docker containers. A possibility would be to follow this path and isolate the konnectors inside docker. It\u2019s a real burden for administrators. And its command line options often changes from one version to another, making difficult to deploy something reliable for self-hosted users. So we will try to avoid it. Isolation in docker contains is mostly a combination of Linux Namespaces, Cgroups, and Seccomp BPF. There are other options with those (see below). Rkt \u00b6 Rkt is a security-minded, standard-based container engine. It is similar to Docker, but Docker needs running a daemon whereas rkt can be launched from command-line with no daemon. NsJail / FireJail \u00b6 NsJail and FireJail are two tools that use Linux Namespaces and Seccomp BPF to reduce the risks to run untrusted applications on Linux. FireJail seems to be more suited for graphical apps, and NsJail for networking services. NaCl / ZeroVM \u00b6 ZeroVM is an open source virtualization technology that is based on the Chromium Native Client (NaCl) project. ZeroVM creates a secure and isolated execution environment which can run a single thread or application. But NaCl is no longer maintained and ZeroVM has some severe limitations, so, it won\u2019t be used. Konnector isolation study \u00b6 The short list of tools which will be tested to isolate connectors is Rkt and NsJail which on paper better fullfill our needs. NsJail \u00b6 NsJail is a lightweight process isolation tool, making use of Linux namespaces and seccomp-bpf syscall filters. It is not a container tool like docker. Its features are quite extensive regarding isolation. The README gives the full list of available options. Although available in the google github, it is not an official google tool. NsJail is: easy to install : just a make away with standard build tools offers a full list or isolation tools lightly documented the only documentation is nsjail -h (also available in the main github page) and it is quite cryptic for a non-sysadmin like me. I could not find any help in any search engine. Some examples are available to run a back in an isolated process and work but I could not run a full nodejs (only nodejs -v worked) The konnectors will need a full nodejs installed on the host Is still actively maintained Rkt \u00b6 Rkt is very similar to docker. It can even directly run docker images from the docker registry, which gives us a lot of existing images to use, even if we want to be able to use other languages than node. For example, we could have also a container dedicated to weboob, another container could use phantomjs or casper and without forcing self-hosted users to do complicated installation procedures. Rkt is : easy to install : debian, rpm package available, archlinux community package : https://github.com/coreos/rkt/releases has network isolation like docker offers CPU, memory limitation, seccomp isolation (but the set of rules to use is out of my understanding) is well documented , complete man pages, but not as well known as docker, then there is not a lot of things to find outside the official documentation. can use docker image directly or can convert them to one runnable aci file with one simple cli command (rkt export) is in active developpement but relatively stable regarding core features. container images can be easily signed and the signature is checked by default when running a container. I managed to run a nodejs container with just the following commands : rkt run --insecure-options=image --interactive docker://node:slim --name nodeslim -- -v rkt list # to get the container uuid rkt export --app=nodeslim &lt;uuid&gt; nodeslim.aci rkt run --insecure-options=image --interactive nodeslim.aci -- -v # to run node -v in the new container Note: the \u2013insecure-options param is to avoid the check of the image signature to ease the demonstration Choice \u00b6 The best choice would be Rkt for it\u2019s ease of use (which is good for contribution) and wide range of isolation features + access to the big docker ecosystem without beeing a burden for the host administrator. Note : the limitation of NsJail I saw might be due to my lack of knowledge regarding system administration. Proposed use of rkt regarding connectors \u00b6 Installation \u00b6 As stated before, rkt is easy to install. It may also be possible to make it available in the cozy-stack docker image but I did not test it (TODO) Image creation \u00b6 To create an ACI file image, you just need to run a docker image one time : rkt run --uuid-file-save=$PWD/uuid --insecure-options=image --interactive docker://node:slim --name nodeslim -- -v rkt export --app=nodeslim `cat uuid` nodeslim.aci &amp;&amp; rm uuid The node:slim image weights 84M at this time. The node:alpine image also exists and is way lighter (19M) but I had problems with DNS with this, and alpine can cause some nasty bugs that are difficult to track. Running a connector \u00b6 A path dedicated to run the konnectors with a predefined list of node packages available (the net module could be mocked with special limitations to blacklist some urls) A script will run the node container giving as option the script to launch. The path is mounted inside the container. The following script does just that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 #!/usr/bin/env bash rm -rf ./container_dir cp -r ./container_dir_template ./container_dir rkt run --net = host --environment = CREDENTIAL = value ; COZY_URL = url --uuid-file-save = $PWD /uuid --volume data,kind = host,source = $PWD /container_dir --insecure-options = image nodeslim.aci --cpu = 100m --memory = 128M --name rktnode --mount volume = data,target = /usr/src/app --exec node -- /usr/src/app/ $1 $2 & amp ; # the container will handle itself the communication with the stack sleep 60 rkt stop --force --uuid-file = uuid rkt rm --uuid-file = uuid rm -rf ./container_dir This script can be run like this : ./rkt.sh mynewkonnector.js If the mynewkonnector.js file is available in the container_dir_template directory. Cons : must forbid access to port 5984 and 6060 + SMTP server The limitation of time, CPU and memory will avoid most DOS attacks (to my knowledge). For memory use, I still don\u2019t see a way to prevent the excessive use of swap from the container. To prevent the connectors from listening to each other, they should be run in containers with different uid, avoiding them to listen to each other. Solution to limit access of the container to 5984 and 6060 ports + SMTP \u00b6 The container must be started in bridged mode. With that, the container still has access to localhost but through a specific IP address visible with ifconfig. That way, the host can have iptable rules to forbid access to specified ports to the bridge. To connect a container in bridge mode : On the host create the file /etc/rkt/net.d/10-containers.conf { \"name\": \"bridge\", \"type\": \"bridge\", \"bridge\": \"rkt-bridge-nat\", \"ipMasq\": true, \"isGateway\": true, \"ipam\": { \"type\": \"host-local\", \"subnet\": \"10.2.0.0/24\", \"routes\": [ { \"dst\": \"0.0.0.0/0\" } ] } } and run your container with the \u201c\u2013net=bridge\u201d option. That way, a new interface is available in the container and gives you access to the host. Konnector install and run details \u00b6 Install \u00b6 The konnectors will be installed in the .cozy_konnectors directory which is in the VFS using git clone (like the apps at the moment). The konnectors installation may be triggered when the user says he wants to use it. The resulting repository is then kept for each run of the konnector. It may then be given to the user the possibility to upgrade the konnector to the latest version if any. To update a given konnector, a git pull command is run on the konnector. Details about running a konnector \u00b6 To run a given konnector, the stack will copy this connector in a \u201crun\u201d directory, which is not in the VFS. This directory will be given to the rocket container as the current working directory with full read and write access on it. This is where the container will put its logs and any temp file needed. There will be also cozy-client.js and the shared libraries in a lib directory inside this directory. The lib directory will be the content of the actual server lib directory . The konnector will be run with the following environment variables : COZY_CREDENTIALS : containing the response to Oauth request as json string COZY_URL : to know what instance is running the konnector COZY_FIELDS : as a json string with all the values from the account associated to the konnector. COZY_PARAMETERS : optional json string associated with the application, used to parameterize a konnector based on a common set of code. In the end of the konnector execution (or timeout), the logs are read in the log.txt file and added to the konnector own log file (in VFS) and the run directory is then destroyed. Multi-account handling \u00b6 This section is devoted to allow the user to use one account for multiple konnectors. It will follow the following constraints in mind: The migration path must be as easy as possible The developpement and maintainance of konnector must also be as easy as possible New doctype : io.cozy.accounts \u00b6 A new doctype will have to be created to allow to keep konnector accounts independently from each konnector. The one once used by the email application seems to be a good candidate : io.cozy.accounts Here is an example document with this doctype : { _id: \"ojpiojpoij\", name: \"user decided name for the account\", accountType: \"google\", login: \"mylogin\", password: \"123456\" } Any attribute needed for the account may be added : email, etc\u2026 Updates needed in existing application and konnectors \u00b6 CRUD manipulation of io.cozy.accounts and linking them with konnectors will be handled by the \u201cmy accounts\u201d client application. Each konnector need also to declare a new field in the \u201cfields\u201d attribute which will be the type of account, related to the accountType field in the new account docType. Ex: module . exports = baseKonnector . createNew ({ name: 'Trainline' , vendorLink: 'www.captaintrain.com' , category: 'transport' , color: { hex: '#48D5B5' , css: '#48D5B5' }, fields: { login: { type: 'text' }, password: { type: 'password' }, folderPath: { type: 'folder' , advanced: true }, accountType: \"trainline\" }, dataType: [ 'bill' ], models: [ Bill ], fetchOperations: [ ... ] }) With this new field, which will appear also in the io.cozy.konnectors docType, the \u201cmy account\u201d client appliction will be able to propose existing accounts of the good type for activating a new konnector. Migration path \u00b6 For the migration of existing, activated konnectors in V2, the type of account for each konnector will have to be indicated in a V2 \u201cmy account\u201d application update. After that, it will be possible to create the accounts associated to each activated konnectors an link the konnectors to these accounts in a migration script. Study on konnectors installation on VFS \u00b6 The VFS is slow and installing npm packages on it will cause some performance problem. We are trying to find solution to handle that. We found 3 possible solutions : Install the konnector on VFS as tar.gz files with all the dependencies included by the konnector developper advantages : easy for the konnector developper, as performant as a cp, no nedd for a compiled version of the konnector source, no duplication of code in the repo drawbacks : The source are not readable in files application then more complicated to study the konnector source, not really nice\u2026 , still could take a lot of space on VFS Use webpack with target: node option to make a node bundle of the dependencies advantages : the konnector itself stays in clear on the VFS drawbacks : forces a compilation of the sources and then a sync between the source and bundle in the git repo by the konnector developper, forces konnector developpers to use webpack. Install the npm dependencies with yarn in an immutable cache (\u2013cache-folder option) in a directory like deps-${konnector-git-sha1} not in VFS. advantages : easier for the konnector developper, no particular dependency handling, no mandatory compilation, just a package.json in the git repository, the cache can be shared by instances drawbacks : node only solution, maybe more work on the cozy-stack side TODO \u00b6 [x] How to install and update the konnectors?

It should cover 2 use cases Devices: The continuous act of syncing change to a subset of the cozy documents and files to and from an user cozy to the same user\u2019s Devices through cozy-desktop and cozy-mobile Sharing: The continuous act of syncing change to a subset of the cozy documents and files to and from another user\u2019s cozy. Replication will not be used for Moving, nor Backup. See associated docs in this folder. CouchDB replication is a well-understood, safe and stable algorithm ensuring replication between two couchdb databases. It is delta-based, and is stateful: we sync changes since a given checkpoint. Files synchronization \u00b6 Replication of too heavy database (with a lot of attachments) has been, in cozy experience, the source of some bugs. To avoid that (and some other issues), in cozy-stack, the attachments are stored outside of couchdb. This means we need a way to synchronize files in parallel to couchdb replication. Rsync is a well-understood, safe and stable algorithm to replicate files hierarchy from one hosts to the other by only transfering changes. It is one-shot and stateless. It could be an inspiration if we have to focus on syncing small changes to big files. The option to use rsync/zsync have been discussed internally (https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack/pull/57 & Sprint Start 2016-10-24), but for now we should focus on using the files/folders couchdb document for synchronization purpose and upload/download the actual binaries with existing files routes or considering webdav. Useful golang package: http://rclone.org/ sync folder in FS / Swift (may be we can add a driver for cozy) Couchdb replication & limitation \u00b6 Couchdb 2 replication protocol is described in details here . Quick summary \u00b6 The replicator figures out what was the last sequence number lastseqno which was correctly synced from the source database, using a _local/:replicationid document. The replicator GET :source/changes?since=lastseqno&limit=batchsize and identify which docs have changed (and their open_revs ). The replicator POST :target/_revs_diff to get a list of all revisions of the changed documents the target does not know. The replicator GET :source/:docid?open_revs=['rev1', ...] several times to retrieve the missing documents revisions. The replicator POST :target/_bulk_docs with these documents revisions. Store the new last sequence number Repeat 2-5 until there is no more changes. Details \u00b6 In step 5, the replicator can also attempt to PUT :target/:docid if doc are too heavy, but this should not happens in cozy-stack considering there wont be attachment in couchdb. In step 4, the replicator can optimize by calling GET The main difference from couchdb 1.X is in the replication history and the manner to determine and store the last sequence number. TODO: actually understand this and how it might increase disk usage if we have a lot of replications. Couchdb _changes and by extension replication can be either by polling or continuous (SSE / COMET) In couchdb benchmarking, we understood that the number of couch databases only use a bit of disk space but no RAM or CPU as long as the database is not used . Having a continuous replication active force us to keep the database file open and will starve RAM & FD usage. Moreover, continuous replication costs a lot (cf. ScienceTeam benchmark). To permit an unlimited number of inactive user on a single cozy-stack process, the stack should avoid continuous replication from couchdb . Two way replication is simply two one way replications Routes used by replication \u00b6 To be a source of replication, the stack only need to support the following route (and query parameters): GET :source/:docid get revisions of a document. The query parameters open_revs, revs, latest is necessary for replication. POST :source/_all_docs is used by current version of cozy-mobile and pouchdb as an optimization to fetch several document\u2019s revision at once. GET :source/_changes get a list of ID -> New Revision since a given sequence number. The query parameters since, limit are necessary for replication. To be a target of replication, the stack need to support the following routes: POST :target/_revs_diff takes a list of ID -> Rev and returns which one are missing. POST :target/_bulk_docs create several documents at once POST :target/_ensure_full_commit ensure the documents are written to disk. This is useless if couchdb is configured without delayed write (default), but remote couchdb will call, so the stack should return the expected 201 In both case, we need to support PUT :both/_local/:revdocid to store the current sequence number. Stack Sync API exploration \u00b6 Easy part: 1 db/doctype on stack AND remote, no binaries \u00b6 We just need to implement the routes described above by proxying to the underlying couchdb database. var db = new PouchDB ( \"my-local-contacts\" ); db . replicate . from ( \"https://bob.cozycloud.cc/data/contacts\" ); db . replicate . to ( \"https://bob.cozycloud.cc/data/contacts\" ); To suport this we need to: Proxy /data/:doctype/_changes route with since, limit, feed=normal. Refuse all filter parameters with a clear error message. (Doc) Add support of open_revs , revs , latest query parameter to GET /data/:doctype/:docid (Doc) Proxy the /data/:doctype/_revs_diff (Doc) and /data/:doctype/_bulk_docs routes (Doc) routes Have /data/:doctype/_ensure_full_commit (Doc) returns 201 This will cover documents part of the Devices use case. Continuous replication \u00b6 It is impossible to implement it by simply proxying to couchdb (see unlimited inactive users). The current version of cozy-desktop uses it. TODISCUSS It could be replaced by 3-minutes polling without big losses in functionality, eventually with some more triggers based on user activity. The big use case for which we might want it is Sharing. But, because Sharing will (first) be stack to stack, we might imagine having the source of event \u201cping\u201d the remote through a separate route. Conclusion: Start with polling replication. Consider alternative notifications mechanism when the usecase appears and eventually use time-limited continuous replication for a few special case (collaborative edit). Realtime \u00b6 One of the cool feature of cozy apps was how changes are sent to the client in realtime through websocket.

See JSON-API specification for more information. Pagination \u00b6 All routes that return a list are (or will be) paginated. As recommended for couchdb, we use cursor-based pagination. The default page limit is determined on a by-route basis. The client can require a different limit using page[limit] query parameter. If the client does not specify a limit, default limit will be used instead.

Prerequisite \u00b6 Have a local stack installed Have an Android emulator created Start the emulator with the ability to remount its file system as writable \u00b6 Since we will need to edit the hosts of the emulator, we need to be able to remount its file system as writable. For that, we need to start our emulator with the following command : ./emulator -writable-system -avd Pixel_API_27 The emulator binary is located at /home/user/Android/Sdk/emulator/ on Linux systems by default.

Therefore we will use the classical stack: a JavaScript web application and cordova At the end of this documentation , you will find how-tos to help you with cordova configuration , webpack builds and cordova deployments for Android and iOS . To create your first Cozy application , just follow the guide. As you can read there, Cozy applications are served by the Cozy server, this is the way that Cozy applications retrieve a token to query data. In the case of a mobile application, you need to retrieve a token differently. Hopefully we provide everything you need to do it easily. You\u2019ll need two libraries: cozy-client ( source ) cozy-bar ( source ) In the case of Cozy web applications served by the Cozy server, these two libraries are injected in the html file with variables {{.CozyClientJS}} and {{.CozyBar}} . Setup index.html \u00b6 First thing first, add JavaScript libraries files into your index.html : <!DOCTYPE html> < html lang = \"en\" > < head > < meta charset = \"utf-8\" > < title > mobile Cozy application with Cordova </ title > < script src = \"cozy-client.js\" ></ script > < script src = \"cozy-bar.js\" ></ script > </ head > < body > <!-- page content --> </ body > </ html > Connect to Cozy server \u00b6 When an user will start your mobile Cozy application, she/he will need to point to her/his server url to ask for permissions for her/his device. This is done by our library cozy-client , you just need to add a HTML form: < form id = \"form\" > < label > What is your cozy server url? < input name = \"url\" id = \"url\" type = \"text\" /> </ label > < button type = \"submit\" > Submit </ button > </ form > const urlInput = document . getElementById ( \"url\" ); const form = document . getElementById ( \"form\" ); form . addEventListener ( \"submit\" , registerClient ); function registerClient ( event ) { event . preventDefault (); const url = urlInput . value ; const { client , token } = await cozyClient . register ( url ); // do whatever you need with client and token like persist } JS Bin on jsbin.com When cozyClient.register(url) is called, the cordova inapp browser plugin is used to display a password request and a permission acceptation page to let the end-user to register her/his device. That\u2019s all! Then you can use the cozy-client library as you would within a classic Cozy application . Initialize the Cozy bar \u00b6 The Cozy bar needs some information to be initialized and its initialization must be done in your front-end code: cozy . bar . init ({ appName : \"App Name\" , appEditor : \"Editor Name\" , iconPath : require ( \"./assets/app-icon.svg\" ), lang : \"en-US\" , replaceTitleOnMobile : true }) Use Cordova \u00b6 Install and setup cordova \u00b6 Cordova is a tool to build Android and iOS applications from a web app. It works with a CLI that needs node . Look at the cordova documentation to install everything needed . Once cordova is installed, just run cordova create cozy-app com.example.cozyapp CozyApp and you get the following structure: ./ \u251c\u2500\u2500 config.xml \u251c\u2500\u2500 hooks \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 README.md \u251c\u2500\u2500 platforms \u251c\u2500\u2500 plugins \u2514\u2500\u2500 www \u251c\u2500\u2500 css \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 index.css \u251c\u2500\u2500 img \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 logo.png \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.html \u2514\u2500\u2500 js \u2514\u2500\u2500 index.js 7 directories, 6 files Note: everything you put in www/ will be served as your application content. Configure your build tool \u00b6 If you use a build tool to transpile your JavaScript code, you need to configure your tool to output the build into www/ . webpack configuration \u00b6 As Webpack is the most used build tool we will show you how to configure it with cordova: Create a webpack.config.js on the root folder of your project with: const path = require ( 'path' ); module . exports = { entry : './src/app.js' , output : { filename : 'bundle.js' , path . resolve ( __dirname , 'www' ) } } And add the output bundle in the www/index.html file: < html > < head > ... </ head > < body > ... < script src = \"bundle.js\" ></ script > </ body > </ html > See the official webpack documentation for more details.

In contrast to konnectors, services have the same permissions as the web application and are not intended to collect information from the outside. It is rather meant to asynchronously analyse data inside the cozy and emit some output once the task is done. However, they share the same mechanisms as the konnectors to describe how and when they should be executed: via our trigger system . Example \u00b6 You can find an example of an existing service in the cozy-banks app . Service declaration \u00b6 The service must be declared in the app manifest .

It must follow the available triggers described in the jobs documentation . In this example, the trigger is a bank operation creation. debounce (optionnal): force a minimal delay between two runs of the service. m is for minutes and s for seconds. if this parameter is omitted, the service will be executed as soon as it can.

For large features with huge impacts on the whole codebase, use feature branches, for example feature/something-new . A feature branch is merged into master when it\u2019s totally functional and validated. Releases \u00b6 TL;DR Create release branch Bump master version Tag beta versions from release branch until it passes all tests Tag stable version from release branch Delete release branch The goal of a release is to have a new stable version of an application or a konnector. A new release is always based on the current state of master , so it consists in creating a new branch release-0.0.0 (with the correct version). Right after starting a new release, master \u2018s version must be bumped, as the previous version is now \u201cfrozen\u201d into the release branch. It is done now to not forget to do it later, or to not have a new unexpected commit before the next version. Example with master being versionned to 1.4.0 , origin being the remote Cozy repository: git checkout master git checkout -b release-1.4.0 git push --set-upstream-to = origin/release-1.4.0 release-1.4.0 git checkout master # Update app version to 1.5.0 in package.json and manifest.webapp git add package.json manifest.webapp git commit -m \"chore: Bump version to 1.5.0\" git push origin HEAD # Go back to work on our release, we will next tag a first beta git checkout release-1.4.0 Once the release branch is created, i.e. the release has started, it must be validated, so a first beta tag is created. Following the previous example: git tag 1 .4.0-beta.1 git push origin 1 .4.0-beta.1 NB: Version number in package.json and manifest.webapp is still 1.4.0 If this beta version is ok, it can be tagged as stable git tag 1 .4.0 git push origin 1 .4.0 But if the beta is not ok, fixes are committed into the release branch and a new beta version is tagged. git tag 1 .4.0-beta.2 git push origin 1 .4.0-beta.2 This process is repeated until a beta version is validated and ready to be tagged as stable. During the release, development continues in master without impacting release-1.4.0 . Once a stable version has been tagged, the release branch must then be merged into master to retrieve all the fixes it contains. Then the release branch can be deleted. git checkout master git pull git merge release-1.0.4 git branch -D release-1.0.4 git push origin :release-1.0.4 git push origin HEAD NB: We take care to get only one release branch at a time. Patches \u00b6 TL;DR Create a patch branch from a stable tag Bump to new patch version Fixes issues and tag new beta versions until everything is ok Tag stable version Cherry-pick fixes into master Delete patch branch If a bug is detected on a stable version, we address it with a patch branch.

Right after starting a new release, master \u2018s version must be bumped, as the previous version is now \u201cfrozen\u201d into the release branch. It is done now to not forget to do it later, or to not have a new unexpected commit before the next version. Example with master being versionned to 1.4.0 , origin being the remote Cozy repository: git checkout master git checkout -b release-1.4.0 git push --set-upstream-to = origin/release-1.4.0 release-1.4.0 git checkout master # Update app version to 1.5.0 in package.json and manifest.webapp git add package.json manifest.webapp git commit -m \"chore: Bump version to 1.5.0\" git push origin HEAD # Go back to work on our release, we will next tag a first beta git checkout release-1.4.0 Once the release branch is created, i.e. the release has started, it must be validated, so a first beta tag is created. Following the previous example: git tag 1 .4.0-beta.1 git push origin 1 .4.0-beta.1 NB: Version number in package.json and manifest.webapp is still 1.4.0 If this beta version is ok, it can be tagged as stable git tag 1 .4.0 git push origin 1 .4.0 But if the beta is not ok, fixes are committed into the release branch and a new beta version is tagged. git tag 1 .4.0-beta.2 git push origin 1 .4.0-beta.2 This process is repeated until a beta version is validated and ready to be tagged as stable. During the release, development continues in master without impacting release-1.4.0 . Once a stable version has been tagged, the release branch must then be merged into master to retrieve all the fixes it contains. Then the release branch can be deleted. git checkout master git pull git merge release-1.0.4 git branch -D release-1.0.4 git push origin :release-1.0.4 git push origin HEAD NB: We take care to get only one release branch at a time.","title":"Releases"},{"location":"/references/git-flow/#patches","text":"TL;DR Create a patch branch from a stable tag Bump to new patch version Fixes issues and tag new beta versions until everything is ok Tag stable version Cherry-pick fixes into master Delete patch branch If a bug is detected on a stable version, we address it with a patch branch.

Two authentication methods are available: Web applications running on the server get a session token when the user log in; OAuth2 for other applications. The database \u00b6 CouchDB is a document database. Everything, from user data to server settings, is stored inside typed documents, identified by an unique id. Two request methods are allowed: map-reduce or Mango , a specific query language. Every document has a doctype , and we keep an index of the definition of every doctype. Binary data are stored outside the database. Depending on the server configuration, they may be stored on a file system or a dedicated object storage like swift .

All you need to have is: NodeJS 10+ Yarn : a NodeJS package manager, like npm Docker to have a Cozy for dev Some basics about developing a single page application in HTML/JS or you just want to learn :) Install the development environment \u00b6 The only tool required to have a Cozy for development is Docker. Install Docker for OSX Install Docker for Windows (We have been told that installing Docker on some familial flavours of Windows may be a bit difficult. It has not been tested yet for this documentation.) Install Docker for GNU/linux: Ubuntu / Fedora / Debian / CentOs On GNU/Linux, according to the documentation : \u00ab The docker daemon binds to a Unix socket instead of a TCP port. By default that Unix socket is owned by the user root and other users can only access it using sudo. If you don\u2019t want to use sudo when you use the docker command, create a Unix group called docker and add users to it. Be warned that the docker group grants privileges equivalent to the root user. You should have a look at Docker\u2019s documentation on security . Every application running inside Cozy is a client-side HTML5 application interacting with your data through the API of the server. To develop an application, you\u2019ll require a running Cozy server. The easiest way is to use the Docker image for developers we provide. Just install it: docker pull cozy/cozy-app-dev Note We update this image on a regular basis with the latest version of the server and our library. Don\u2019t forget to update the image by running docker pull cozy/cozy-app-dev from time to time to keep your Cozy dev up to date. Create your application \u00b6 You can boostrap your application from scratch if you want, but we highly recommand to use our dedicated community tool create-cozy-app to bootstrap very easily a Cozy application for you. This tool will generate an application using React, the framework we internally use in the Cozy Front team. But options are available if you want to use other frameworks. To do so, run directly create-cozy-app without installing it globally by using the yarn create cozy-app command to bootstrap your application: yarn create cozy-app mycozyapp The script will download some dependencies (may take a while) and ask you a few questions, then create an application skeleton inside mycozyapp . Here is a quick demo of what\u2019s happening: That\u2019s it! You can already start developing: cd mycozyapp yarn start This command will run webpack in a watching mode with a server (webpack-dev-server) to serve application assets. a Cozy stack using docker (the image cozy/cozy-app-dev ) to serve your application inside it. The same docker image starts a CouchDB containing your data (be careful, since a data volume is not attached by default, your data will disappear on restart. You should start the docker image manually if you want to persist your data). Your application will be available at http:// .cozy.tools:8080. Password is cozy . In this mode HMR (Hot Module Replacement) is available to help you with the application development. Going Further \u00b6 What is cozy.tools ? \u00b6 You may see in our documentation that we use *.cozy.tools as domain for the local Cozy. Since Cozy uses subdomains to serve the applications, we can\u2019t use directly localhost as it. We have just parameterized this *.cozy.tools domain to always redirect to 127.0.0.1 , your local computer address. With that, no need to configure your environment to set extra local hosts for development anymore. How the application works? \u00b6 The minimal application consist of only two files: an HTML file, index.html , with the markup and the code of your application a manifest describing the application. It\u2019s a JSON file named manifest.webapp with the name of the application, the permissions it requires\u2026 We\u2019ll have a deeper look to it content later. Your application requires some informations to interact with the server API, for example the URL of its entrypoint, and an auth token. This data will be dynamically injected into index.html when it serves the page. So the index.html file has to contain some string that will be replaced by the server. The general syntax of this variables is {{\u2026}} , so don\u2019t use this syntax for other purpose in the page, for example inside comments. You can use the following variables: {{.Domain}} will be substituted by the URL of the API entrypoint {{.Token}} will be replaced by a token that authenticate your application when accessing the API {{.Locale}} : the lang f the instance {{.AppName}} : the name of the application {{.AppNamePrefix}} : the name prefix of the application {{.AppSlug}} : the slug of the application {{.AppEditor}} : the editor of the application {{.IconPath}} will be replaced by HTML code to display the favicon {{.CozyClientJS}} will be replaced with HTML code to inject the Cozy client library (old Cozy client) {{.CozyBar}} will be replaced with HTML code to inject the upper menu bar {{.ThemeCSS}} will be replaced by the theme.css . It is empty by default, but can be overrided by using contexts . {{.Favicon}} will be replaced by the favicon served by the stack. This allows to get this kind of index.html : <!DOCTYPE html> < html lang = \"{{.Locale}}\" > < head > < meta charset = \"utf-8\" > < title > My Awesome App for Cozy </ title > < meta name = \"viewport\" content = \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" > < link rel = \"stylesheet\" src = \"my-app.css\" > {{.ThemeCSS}} {{.CozyClientJS}} {{.CozyBar}} </ head > < body > < div role = \"application\" data-cozy-token = \"{{.Token}}\" data-cozy-stack = \"{{.Domain}}\" > </ div > < script src = \"my-app.js\" ></ script > </ body > </ html > Read the application manifest \u00b6 Each application must have a \u201cmanifest\u201d. It\u2019s a JSON file named manifest.webapp stored at the root of theapplication directory. It describes the application, the type of documents it uses, the permissions it requires\u2026 Here\u2019s a sample manifest: { \"name\" : \"My Awesome application\" , \"name_prefix\" : \"\" , \"slug\" : \"myapp\" , \"permissions\" : { \"apps\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.apps\" }, \"permissions\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.permissions\" }, \"settings\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.settings\" }, \"sample\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.dev.sample\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"GET\" , \"POST\" , \"PUT\" , \"PATCH\" , \"DELETE\" ] }, \"jobs\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.jobs\" } }, \"routes\" : { \"/\" : { \"folder\" : \"/\" , \"index\" : \"index.html\" , \"public\" : false }, \"/public\" : { \"folder\" : \"/public\" , \"index\" : \"index.html\" , \"public\" : true } } } Permissions \u00b6 Applications require permissions to use most of the APIs. Permissions can be described inside the manifest, so theserver can ask the user to grant them during installation. Applications can also request permissions at run time. A permission must at type contain a target, the type of objects the application want to interact with. Can be a document type, or an action on the server. By default, all grant on this object are granted, but we can also request fine grained permissions, for example limiting to read access. We can also limit the scope to a subset of thedocuments. In the manifest, each permission is an object, with a random name and some properties: - type : mandatory the document type or action name - description : a text that will be displayed to the user to explain why the application require this permission - verbs : an array of HTTP verbs. For example, to limit permissions to read access, use [\"GET\"] - selector : a document attribute to limit access to a subset of documents - values : array of allowed values for this attribute. An application can request a token that grant access to a subset of its own permissions. For example if the application has full access to the files, it can obtain a token that give only read access on a file. Thus, the application can make some documents publicly available. The public page of the application will use this token asauthentication token when accessing the API. Samples \u00b6 Application require full access to files: { \"permissions\" : { \"files\" : { \"description\" : \"\u2026\" , \"type\" : \"io.cozy.files\" }, } } Application want to be able to read the contact informations of cozy@cozycloud.cc { \"permissions\" : { \"contact\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.contacts\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"GET\" ], \"selector\" : \"email\" , \"values\" : [ \"cozy@cozycloud.cc\" ] } } } Routing \u00b6 The application must declare all of its URLs (routes) inside the manifest. A route is an object associating an URL toan HTML file. Each route has the following properties: folder : the base folder of the route index : the name of the file inside this folder public : a boolean specifying whether the route is public or private (default). Sample: \"routes\" : { \"/admin\" : { \"folder\" : \"/\" , \"index\" : \"admin.html\" , \"public\" : false }, \"/public\" : { \"folder\" : \"/public\" , \"index\" : \"index.html\" , \"public\" : true }, \"/assets\" : { \"folder\" : \"/assets\" , \"public\" : true } } Behind the magic \u00b6 Some server APIs may not be available right now through the library. If you want to use one of this method, you\u2019llhave to call it manually. We\u2019ll describe here how to access the API without using the Cozy Client library. Connecting to the API requires three things: its URL, injected into the page through the {{.Domain}} variable the application auth token, injected into the page through the {{.Token}} variable. Each request sent to theserver must include this token in the Authorization header the session cookie, created when you connect to your server. This is an HttpOnly cookie , meaning that JavaScriptapplications can\u2019t read it. This prevent a malicious script to stole the cookie. Here\u2019s a sample code that get API informations provided by the server and query the API: < div data-cozy-token = \"{{.Token}}\" data-cozy-domain = \"{{.Domain}}\" /> document . addEventListener ( 'DOMContentLoaded' , () => { \"use strict\" ; const app = document . querySelector ( '[data-cozy-token]' ); fetch ( `// ${ app . dataset . cozyDomain } /apps` , { method : 'GET' , headers : { Authorization : `Bearer ${ app . dataset . cozyToken } ` // Here we use the auth token }, credentials : 'include' // don\u2019t forget to include the session cookie }) . then ( function ( response ) { if ( response . ok ) { response . json (). then (( result ) => { console . log ( result ); }); } else { throw new Error ( 'Network response was not ok.' ); } }) . catch ( function ( error ) { console . log ( 'There has been a problem with your fetch operation: ' + error . message ); }); }); Handle data with cozy-client \u00b6 cozy-client is a simple and declarative way of managing cozy-stack API callsand resulting data. It is a convenient yet powerful way to bind cozy-stack queries to your components. Getting started How to API docs Discover the Cozy Bar \u00b6 The Cozy Bar is a component that display the Cozy menu on the top of yourapplication and allow inter-apps features like content sharing. Your application interacts with this component through cozy-bar.js , a library injected into your pages by theserver when you add {{.CozyBar}} in the header. It exposes an API behind the window.cozy.bar namespace. Before using it, you have to initialize the library: window.cozy.bar.init({appName: \"Mon application\"}) . Style with Cozy UI \u00b6 If you plan to build a webapp to run on Cozy, you\u2019ll probably want to use a simple and elegant solution to build your interfaces without the mess of dealing with complex markup and CSS. Then Cozy UI is here for you! It relies on Stylus as preprocessor. You can add it as a library in your project to use it out-of-the-box.","title":"app"},{"location":"/tutorials/app/#prerequisites","text":"Developing an application for Cozy is quite easy.

Each connector is an independent application, managed by the [Cozy Collect] application. To protect your data, each connector runs inside a container in order to sandbox all their interactions with your data. \u26a0\ufe0f For historical reasons, in the Cozy codebase, a cozy connector is named konnector, please follow this convention if modifying an existing application. How does it work? \u00b6 A connector is a NodeJS script. The target node version used to run your connector is the version 8. Like client side apps, connectors communicate with the Cozy Stack using its HTTP API, and get a unique auth token every time they start. They need to register with a manifest, and ask the user for permissions. To facilitate connector development, a npm package, cozy-konnector-libs , provides some shared libraries that are adapted to be used for a connector: cheerio to easily query a HTML page request-promise : request with Promise support request-debug that displays all the requests and responses in the standard output. Toggle debug option in requestFactory options Besides, you\u2019ll probably need some other npm packages to help you run your connector: momentjs or date-fns to manage dates bluebird to get enhanced promises When the connector is started, it also receives some data via environment variables: COZY_CREDENTIALS : an auth token used by cozy-client-js to communicate with the server COZY_URL : the Cozy Stack API entry point COZY_FIELDS : settings coming from [Cozy Collect] and filled by the user (login, password, directory path). These variables are used by the connector and the cozy-client to configure the connection to the Cozy Stack with the right permissions as defined in the connector manifest. They are simulated in standalone mode so that you do not need a real Cozy Stack to develop a connector. [ More about BaseKonnector ] From the server point of view, each connector is a job which is executed periodically via a trigger . [ More about Cozy Stack jobs ] Let\u2019s create our first connector \u00b6 The easiest way to create a new connector is to use cozy-konnector-template : \u2139 There is also a (french) youtube video to create your first connector Run the sample \u00b6 First of all, download or clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/konnectors/cozy-konnector-template cozy-konnector-newservice cd cozy-konnector-newservice rm -rf .git git init yarn install # or npm install note: we use yarn , but if you prefer npm , keep using it, everything should work. The connector is ready to run with sample code. As a demo we will scrape a fictional website: books.toscrape.com , for which you do not need credentials . As indicated in the README.md file, just run: yarn standalone # or npm run standalone The very first run will create a konnector-dev-config.json file that allows you to configure the connector input when executing it with the CLI. This configuration comes from [Cozy Collect] when deployed. { \"COZY_URL\" : \"http://cozy.tools:8080\" , \"fields\" : { // configuration injected to the start function } } The fields property allows you to set credentials for the targeted web service, such as login and password as if they come from Cozy Stack (so from a real Cozy Cloud instance). You can add as many fields as the targeted service needs. The COZY_URL property will be used later. You do not need to change it for now. As explained earlier, the demo website books.toscrape.com does not need any credentials. But for the code to run without error, you need to register a fake login and a fake password: { \"COZY_URL\" : \"http://cozy.tools:8080\" , \"fields\" : { \"login\" : \"zuck.m@rk.fb\" , \"password\" : \"123456\" } } In the template, this configuration file is already added to .gitignore file to be sure your credentials stay private. Now you can run the connector again in standalone mode to see how jpg and related data are downloaded. In this mode, [ cozy-client-js ] is stubbed and all data meant to be saved in a cozy are displayed in the standard output and files are saved in the ./data directory of the connector. This is useful to start developing your connector without handling the state of a real Cozy Stack . Please check CLI section of the documentation for more information. Implement your connector \u00b6 There are four steps for a connector to save data to Cozy Stack : authentication request data parse and format data save data to cozy stack You can see these steps in the src/index.js in the konnectors/template : async function start ( fields ) { // step 1. log ( 'info' , 'Authenticating ...' ) await authenticate ( fields . login , fields . password ) log ( 'info' , 'Successfully logged in' ) // step 2. // The BaseKonnector instance expects a Promise as return of the function log ( 'info' , 'Fetching the list of documents' ) const $ = await request ( ` ${ baseUrl } /index.html` ) // step 3. log ( 'info' , 'Parsing list of documents' ) const documents = await parseDocuments ( $ ) // step 4. // here we use the saveBills function even if what we fetch are not bills, but this is the most // common case in connectors log ( 'info' , 'Saving data to Cozy' ) await saveBills ( documents , fields . folderPath , { // this is a bank identifier which will be used to link bills to bank operations. These // identifiers should be at least a word found in the title of a bank operation related to this // bill. It is not case sensitive. identifiers : [ 'books' ] }) } Authentication \u00b6 Open the src/index.js file, there are comments to guide you through it. The very first step is to be able to authenticate to the remote service, this is done with the line: note: don\u2019t forget to add your additional fields if you have some. await authenticate ( fields . login , fields . password ) There are many obstacles at this level: is there a captcha? is there a 2FA? how is the <form> ? note: if the remote service exposes an API, you should use classical request call. Let\u2019s say the remote service exposes a simple classical form like https://www.trainline.eu/signin: < form id = \"signin-form\" novalidate = \"\" class = \"signin__form\" data-ember-action = \"\" data-ember-action-680 = \"680\" > < input name = \"email\" autocomplete = \"on\" placeholder = \"Email Address\" id = \"ember691\" class = \"ember-text-field textfield ember-view\" data-enpass . usermodified = \"yes\" type = \"email\" > < input name = \"password\" autocomplete = \"on\" placeholder = \"Password\" id = \"ember696\" class = \"ember-text-field textfield ember-view\" data-enpass . usermodified = \"yes\" type = \"password\" > < div class = \"signin__forgot\" > < span data-ember-action = \"\" data-ember-action-697 = \"697\" > < a href = \"/password\" id = \"ember698\" class = \"ember-view\" > Forgot your password? </ a > </ span > </ div > < div class = \"signin__buttons \" > < div class = \"signin__buttons-block\" > < button type = \"submit\" class = \"signin__button\" > Sign In </ button > </ div > </ div > </ form > Find a CSS selector for the form tag: form#signin-form . Find the name of the input tags used to host user\u2019s credentials: email and password . You are ready to complete the signin(options) object called in the authenticate(username, password) function: function authenticate ( username , password ) { return signin ({ url : `https://www.trainline.eu/signin` , formSelector : 'form#signin-form' , formData : { email : username , password }, // \"email\" and \"password\" correspond to the name attribut of the HTML inputs validate : ( statusCode , $ ) => { // write some code to validate the form submission } }) } To implement the validate function, you need to check what is happening on a successful login and on an unsuccessful login. With the https://www.trainline.eu/signin example, fill the form with wrong credentials, open your browser\u2019s devtools (and check the network tab) and submit the form. Here it is clear, on incorrect credentials, the response have a status code 422 : HTTP/2.0 422 No Reason Phrase Do the same with valid credentials. HTTP/2.0 200 OK Then you can write a simple and straight forward validate code: function authenticate ( username , password ) { return signin ({ url : `https://www.trainline.eu/signin` , formSelector : 'form#signin-form' , formData : { email : username , password }, validate : ( statusCode , $ ) => { return statusCode === 200 || log ( 'error' , 'Invalid credentials' ) } }) } However if the target website doesn\u2019t use statusCode correctly you can also use fullResponse.request.uri.href to check if there is a redirection to a page that requires to be logged in : validate : ( statusCode , $ , fullResponse ) => { return fullResponse . request . uri . href == 'https://example.com/account' || log ( 'error' , 'Invalid credentials' ) } It is also possible to use Cheerio to check if an HTML element is present in the web page or not : validate : ( statusCode , $ ) => { return $ ( 'a[href=\"https://example.com/logout\"]' ). length == 1 || log ( 'error' , $ ( '.error' ). text ()) } Request data \u00b6 Once the connector is able to be authenticated by the online service, the next step is to fetch data. The most common case is that the invoices we want to fetch are listed in a HTML page. So to request data, we fetch the target webpage that contains invoices list. But sometimes, the webpage is a JavaScript page that uses a JSON API URL. JSON is easier to parse than full HTML webpages. For the purpose of this guide, let\u2019s consider we are in the case of a full HTML webpage, like the service given as an example in the template: http://books.toscrape.com This is the easiest part, just fetch the webpage: const $ = await request ( 'http://books.toscrape.com/index.html' ) The $ variable is set to a cheerio object with useful API to crawl the webpage . \u2139 You can name this variable as you want and create as many as you want Cheerio variables such as : $doc or $page . That object will be very useful for the next step. Parse the document \u00b6 We want to get every <article /> of the page in a JavaScript Array: const articles = []. map . call ( $ ( 'article' , node => node )) For every book, we want to catch the title attribute of this tag article h3 a . This is a CSS Selector that cheerio understands to select some part of the tree. In order to crawl a list of items to create an Array of JSON object, we can create our own function or use the function scrape from the connector libs : const docs = scrape ( $ , { title : { sel : 'h3 a' , attr : 'title' }, amount : { sel : '.price_color' , parse : normalizePrice }, url : { sel : 'h3 a' , attr : 'href' , parse : url => ` ${ baseUrl } / ${ url } ` }, fileurl : { sel : 'img' , attr : 'src' , parse : src => ` ${ baseUrl } / ${ src } ` }, filename : { sel : 'h3 a' , attr : 'title' , parse : title => ` ${ title } .jpg` } }, 'article' ) Keep in mind that there are many useful CSS Pseudo-classes and Combinators that you can use in your CSS selectors to help you select HTML elements. This code will loop on <article /> and for each item will create a JSON object with the selector sel and the value of attribute attr if specified, otherwise it takes the value of the child node, this value can be edited with the parse function. Here is a sample for the following markup from http://books.toscrape.com: < article class = \"product_pod\" > < div class = \"image_container\" > < a href = \"catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html\" > < img src = \"media/cache/2c/da/2cdad67c44b002e7ead0cc35693c0e8b.jpg\" alt = \"A Light in the Attic\" class = \"thumbnail\" > </ a > </ div > < p class = \"star-rating Three\" > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > </ p > < h3 > < a href = \"catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html\" title = \"A Light in the Attic\" > A Light in the ... </ a > </ h3 > < div class = \"product_price\" > < p class = \"price_color\" > \u00a351.77 </ p > < p class = \"instock availability\" > < i class = \"icon-ok\" ></ i > In stock </ p > < form > < button type = \"submit\" class = \"btn btn-primary btn-block\" data-loading-text = \"Adding...\" > Add to basket </ button > </ form > </ div > </ article > And we will get the following JSON object: { \"title\" : \"A Light in the Attic\" , \"amount\" : 51.77 , \"url\" : \"http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html\" , \"fileurl\" : \"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/2c/da/2cdad67c44b002e7ead0cc35693c0e8b.jpg\" , \"filename\" : \"A Light in the Attic.jpg\" } fileurl is used to tell Cozy where to find the file (here an image) to retreive. Then you can save it to Cozy Stack (see section below). There are many document types (Doctypes) you can store in your Cozy, such as : - Bills - Contacts - Bank - and so on\u2026 The code sample includes some other function to manipulate the result object, but we have the idea. Once we build a correct object, we can save it to Cozy Stack. Save data to Cozy Stack \u00b6 In the example we use some built-in function to save a bill to the Cozy Stack. But there is a bunch of functions available depending on what you want: addData hydrateAndFilter saveBills to save invoices files (this function use saveFiles ) that can be linked to your bank transactions. saveFiles to upload files to Cozy Drive. and so on\u2026 For example, to save bills to Cozy you have to start by recovering all required fields for a data type io.cozy.bills using the scrape function, and then you can use the function saveBills to save your docs to Cozy Stack as shown below: await saveBills ( documents , fields , { idenditifiers : [ 'vendor' ], // name of the target website contentType : 'application/pdf' }) documents is the list of bills returned by the function parseDocuments after the page scraping . We can find more information in the libs repository . Now that we pass on every steps, it is time to test the connector with yarn standalone . We will see next how to connect it effectively to a Cozy Stack. Going further \u00b6 Connector structure \u00b6 Basically, a connector is just a function passed to the BaseKonnector constructor, and which eventually returns a promise: To create the connector, just create a new instance of BaseKonnector with a function as argument: const { BaseKonnector } = require ( 'cozy-konnector-libs' ) module . exports = new BaseKonnector ( fields => { // use fields to get user credentials and choices console . log ( fields , 'fields' ) }) Typical workflow \u00b6 Everytime the connector is run, it will call the function and wait for the resolution of the returned promise. This function can then: log into the target website, fetch data, and save them as an array of objects with specific attributes expected by the save function ( saveFiles , addData , hydrateAndFilter , saveBills ). A basic connector workflow involves: authenticate on the website or API. Might be tricky, but that\u2019s the fun :-) getting data from the online service. You can get the data by calling an API or scraping the webpage. Check if the webpage itself is not using an API to retrieve data, might speed up our job. Mobile phones applications usually connects to an API that might be a reliable source of data. A quick exemple of a scraper here . filtering data to remove the ones already present inside the database using hydrateAndFilter save the filtered data into the database ( addData ) save the related files using ( saveFiles ) Error handling \u00b6 If your connector hits an issue fetching or saving the data, it can return an error code by throwing it as an error. The error codes are defined inside the [Cozy Collect] application and will display an explicit error to the user: LOGIN_FAILED : the connector could not login NOT_EXISTING_DIRECTORY : the folder specified as folder_to_save does not exist (checked automatically by the BaseKonnector) UNKNOWN_ERROR : there was an unexpected error, please take a look at the logs to know what happened VENDOR_DOWN : the target web site is down now USER_ACTION_NEEDED : The user needs to login to the service to do manual actions (could be Terms Of Service to validate) You can get the list of error codes in require('cozy-konnector-libs').errors ( source ) const { BaseKonnector , errors } = require ( 'cozy-konnector-libs' ) module . exports = new BaseKonnector ( fields => { // Here, the following message will be displayed in cozy-collect : \"Bad credentials. Check the konnector fields and run the connection again.\" throw new Error ( errors . LOGIN_FAILED ) }) cozy-konnector-libs \u00b6 The Cozy Konnector Libs provide several useful methods for common tasks: BaseKonnector : creates the connector and fetches from the stack the connector\u2019s parameters (COZY_FIELDS\u2026) cozyClient gives an instance of cozy-client-js already initialized according to COZY_URL , and COZY_CREDENTIALS . Your code can immediately interact with the server thanks to this client. requestFactory a function which returns an instance of request-promise initialized with defaults often used in connector development. log allows to log messages with different levels hydrateAndFilter to filter data addData to store the retrieved data into the cozy linkBankOperations to link a bill to a bank operation saveBills which uses hydrateAndFilter, addData, saveFiles and linkBankOperations and which is specific to bills updateOrCreate create or update documents inside database htmlToPDF to convert HTML code to PDF content to insert into a PDF file created with the createCozyPDFDocument function createCozyPDFDocument to create a new PDF file to pass to htmlToPDF Linking your connector to a cozy : dev mode \u00b6 After several yarn standalone , your connector is able to automaticaly gather data from the targeted web service. It\u2019s time now to put this data in a real cozy. Here comes the dev mode . For that your connector needs more setup : a manifest.konnector file a COZY_URL section in konnector-dev-config.json The manifest \u00b6 Each connector is described by a manifest. This is a JSON file named manifest.konnector at the root of your code folder. It should include the following minimal information: { \"name\" : \"konnector name\" , \"type\" : \"node\" , \"slug\" : \"konnectorslug\" , \"description\" : \"description\" , \"source\" : \"git://github.com/cozy/cozy-konnector-thename.git\" , \"permissions\" : { \"accounts\" : { \"description\" : \"Required to get the account's data\" , \"type\" : \"io.cozy.accounts\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"GET\" ] } } } cozy-konnector-template already has a manifest which you can customize. You may add some permissions for your own doctype. Here is the detailed list of fields for a connector manifest file. You can also get more information on permissions in the official cozy-stack documentation konnector-dev-config.json \u00b6 If you want to put data from your connector to a real cozy, your must define where to find this cozy, and this must be a cozy for which you have the credentials. Here comes the COZY_URL in konnector-dev-config.json which defines just that. Run the dev mode \u00b6 Then you just have to run: yarn dev For the first run, the CLI will open a tab in your browser asking you to grant permissions to the connector. The connector will then save data directly into your cozy. This will validate that your manifest has the needed permissions on the data you want to save. This is the dev mode. Integration in the store for all the users \u00b6 To run a connector, we do not want the cozy to install all dependencies of the connector each time it installs it. To avoid this, the connectors need to be compiled into one file in a dedicated branch of the repository and the repository needs to be a public git repository. The package.json file from cozy-konnector-template gives you the commands to do this : yarn build and yarn deploy but the last one needs to be configured in package.json Once your public git repository is configured, you only have to declare it. Cozy will soon have a store for connectors and you will be able to publish connectors yourself. But at the moment, you need to declare your new connector on the cozy forum . The Cozy team will review your code and add your connector to the [Cozy Collect] application. To make the connector available more quickly for all cozys, you can follow this few steps of packaging: Icon \u00b6 You need to push an icon in assets/ . Please respect this rules : Square icon, possibly a png or svg Try the Apple app store icon if needed Package.json \u00b6 Edit the name to be cozy-konnector-<slug> Edit the repository URL Edit the command deploy with the correct repository URL Manifest.konnector \u00b6 Edit the name with a nice name (Capitals and spaces allowed here) Edit icon as needed Edit slug (no capitals and no spaces here) Edit source with the correct repository URL Add a correct vendor link Choose one or more categories (used to sort connectors in Cozy Store) in this list : banking, shopping, insurance, isp, telecom, energy, public_service, other . If needed, change the input type the target website use to login the user: text , email or phone for instance, this will enforce pre-checking Edit for both locales en and fr the short description and long description FAQ \u00b6 When I run my connector, a ghost node process eats all my memory \u00b6 Cozy-konnector-libs uses cheerio which is great but causes some problems when you try to console.log a cheerio object. In standalone or dev mode, the BaseKonnector tries to catch errors and display a maximum of details about them. But when the error contains a cheerio object, the problem happens. If you get this problem, catch the error yourself and only display the message : . catch ( err ) { console . log ( err . message ) // good console . log ( err ) // bad } How do I scrap a website \u00b6 Use the request function from cozy-konnector-libs with the proper options. Here\u2019s a sample code that will fetch the login page to get the value of the anti-CSRF token, submit the login form, browse to the bills page and fetch a bill: const { BaseKonnector , requestFactory } = require ( 'cozy-konnector-libs' ) const rq = requestFactory ({ jar : true , // handle the cookies like a browser json : false , // do not try to parse the result as a json document cheerio : true // automatically parse the result with [cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio) }) const moment = require ( 'moment' ) module . exports = new BaseKonnector ( function fetch ( fields ) { return rq ( \"https://login.remote.web\" ) . then ( $ => { // the result is automatically wrapped with cheerio and you can use it like jQuery const form = { form : { login : fields . login , password : fields . password , csrf_token : $ ( '[name=\"csrf_token\"]' ). val (), } } return rq ({ method : 'POST' , form }) }) . then ( $ => rq ( \"https://admin.remote.web/bills\" )) . then ( $ => { return [{ date : moment ( $ ( \"#bill_date\" )), value : $ ( \"#bill_value\" )}] }) . then ( entries => addData ( entries , 'io.cozy.bills' )) }) What does the yarn deploy command do ? \u00b6 This will deploy a compiled version of your connector in a dedicated branch of your git repository using git-directory-deploy . This deployed version can then be referenced to cozy-app-publish to deploy your connector to the registry. I want to pass secret variables to my connector without hardcoding it in the source code \u00b6 COZY_PARAMETERS environment variable will help you. In standalone mode or dev mode, you can init it in konnector-dev-config.json : \"COZY_PARAMETERS\" : { \"secret\" : { \"mySecretKey\" : \"s3cr3tk3y\" } } In your connector, you will get these secrets as a second parameter in your main function. module . exports = new BaseKonnector ( start ) async function start ( fields , cozyParameters ) { log ( 'info' , cozyParameters . secret . mySecretKey ) } // -> \"s3cr3tk3y\" If you want to know how this works in a real cozy, you can find more information on Stack documentation","title":"konnector"},{"location":"/tutorials/konnector/#introduction","text":"A connector (also known as konnector ) is a script that imports data from another web service and put those data into your cozy.

Toggle debug option in requestFactory options Besides, you\u2019ll probably need some other npm packages to help you run your connector: momentjs or date-fns to manage dates bluebird to get enhanced promises When the connector is started, it also receives some data via environment variables: COZY_CREDENTIALS : an auth token used by cozy-client-js to communicate with the server COZY_URL : the Cozy Stack API entry point COZY_FIELDS : settings coming from [Cozy Collect] and filled by the user (login, password, directory path). These variables are used by the connector and the cozy-client to configure the connection to the Cozy Stack with the right permissions as defined in the connector manifest. They are simulated in standalone mode so that you do not need a real Cozy Stack to develop a connector.

The connector is ready to run with sample code. As a demo we will scrape a fictional website: books.toscrape.com , for which you do not need credentials . As indicated in the README.md file, just run: yarn standalone # or npm run standalone The very first run will create a konnector-dev-config.json file that allows you to configure the connector input when executing it with the CLI. This configuration comes from [Cozy Collect] when deployed. { \"COZY_URL\" : \"http://cozy.tools:8080\" , \"fields\" : { // configuration injected to the start function } } The fields property allows you to set credentials for the targeted web service, such as login and password as if they come from Cozy Stack (so from a real Cozy Cloud instance). You can add as many fields as the targeted service needs. The COZY_URL property will be used later. You do not need to change it for now. As explained earlier, the demo website books.toscrape.com does not need any credentials. But for the code to run without error, you need to register a fake login and a fake password: { \"COZY_URL\" : \"http://cozy.tools:8080\" , \"fields\" : { \"login\" : \"zuck.m@rk.fb\" , \"password\" : \"123456\" } } In the template, this configuration file is already added to .gitignore file to be sure your credentials stay private. Now you can run the connector again in standalone mode to see how jpg and related data are downloaded. In this mode, [ cozy-client-js ] is stubbed and all data meant to be saved in a cozy are displayed in the standard output and files are saved in the ./data directory of the connector. This is useful to start developing your connector without handling the state of a real Cozy Stack .

Let\u2019s say the remote service exposes a simple classical form like https://www.trainline.eu/signin: < form id = \"signin-form\" novalidate = \"\" class = \"signin__form\" data-ember-action = \"\" data-ember-action-680 = \"680\" > < input name = \"email\" autocomplete = \"on\" placeholder = \"Email Address\" id = \"ember691\" class = \"ember-text-field textfield ember-view\" data-enpass . usermodified = \"yes\" type = \"email\" > < input name = \"password\" autocomplete = \"on\" placeholder = \"Password\" id = \"ember696\" class = \"ember-text-field textfield ember-view\" data-enpass . usermodified = \"yes\" type = \"password\" > < div class = \"signin__forgot\" > < span data-ember-action = \"\" data-ember-action-697 = \"697\" > < a href = \"/password\" id = \"ember698\" class = \"ember-view\" > Forgot your password? </ a > </ span > </ div > < div class = \"signin__buttons \" > < div class = \"signin__buttons-block\" > < button type = \"submit\" class = \"signin__button\" > Sign In </ button > </ div > </ div > </ form > Find a CSS selector for the form tag: form#signin-form .

With the https://www.trainline.eu/signin example, fill the form with wrong credentials, open your browser\u2019s devtools (and check the network tab) and submit the form. Here it is clear, on incorrect credentials, the response have a status code 422 : HTTP/2.0 422 No Reason Phrase Do the same with valid credentials.

The most common case is that the invoices we want to fetch are listed in a HTML page. So to request data, we fetch the target webpage that contains invoices list. But sometimes, the webpage is a JavaScript page that uses a JSON API URL. JSON is easier to parse than full HTML webpages. For the purpose of this guide, let\u2019s consider we are in the case of a full HTML webpage, like the service given as an example in the template: http://books.toscrape.com This is the easiest part, just fetch the webpage: const $ = await request ( 'http://books.toscrape.com/index.html' ) The $ variable is set to a cheerio object with useful API to crawl the webpage . \u2139 You can name this variable as you want and create as many as you want Cheerio variables such as : $doc or $page .

This is a CSS Selector that cheerio understands to select some part of the tree. In order to crawl a list of items to create an Array of JSON object, we can create our own function or use the function scrape from the connector libs : const docs = scrape ( $ , { title : { sel : 'h3 a' , attr : 'title' }, amount : { sel : '.price_color' , parse : normalizePrice }, url : { sel : 'h3 a' , attr : 'href' , parse : url => ` ${ baseUrl } / ${ url } ` }, fileurl : { sel : 'img' , attr : 'src' , parse : src => ` ${ baseUrl } / ${ src } ` }, filename : { sel : 'h3 a' , attr : 'title' , parse : title => ` ${ title } .jpg` } }, 'article' ) Keep in mind that there are many useful CSS Pseudo-classes and Combinators that you can use in your CSS selectors to help you select HTML elements. This code will loop on <article /> and for each item will create a JSON object with the selector sel and the value of attribute attr if specified, otherwise it takes the value of the child node, this value can be edited with the parse function. Here is a sample for the following markup from http://books.toscrape.com: < article class = \"product_pod\" > < div class = \"image_container\" > < a href = \"catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html\" > < img src = \"media/cache/2c/da/2cdad67c44b002e7ead0cc35693c0e8b.jpg\" alt = \"A Light in the Attic\" class = \"thumbnail\" > </ a > </ div > < p class = \"star-rating Three\" > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > </ p > < h3 > < a href = \"catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html\" title = \"A Light in the Attic\" > A Light in the ... </ a > </ h3 > < div class = \"product_price\" > < p class = \"price_color\" > \u00a351.77 </ p > < p class = \"instock availability\" > < i class = \"icon-ok\" ></ i > In stock </ p > < form > < button type = \"submit\" class = \"btn btn-primary btn-block\" data-loading-text = \"Adding...\" > Add to basket </ button > </ form > </ div > </ article > And we will get the following JSON object: { \"title\" : \"A Light in the Attic\" , \"amount\" : 51.77 , \"url\" : \"http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html\" , \"fileurl\" : \"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/2c/da/2cdad67c44b002e7ead0cc35693c0e8b.jpg\" , \"filename\" : \"A Light in the Attic.jpg\" } fileurl is used to tell Cozy where to find the file (here an image) to retreive.
