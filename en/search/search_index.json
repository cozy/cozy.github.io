Publish \u00b6 What\u2019s cozy-app-publish? \u00b6 cozy-app-publish is a command line tool that publish a Cozy application to the Cozy registry according to some options. Requirements \u00b6 Node.js version 8 or higher; Install \u00b6 yarn add --dev cozy-app-publish Registry documentation \u00b6 You can find more information about the registry and how to prepare an application to be published in the official registry documentation . Usage via Travis CI (recommended) \u00b6 First of all, don\u2019t forget to build the application: # build the application (in the ./build folder here) yarn build Then, just publish it using the Travis CI workflow: # publish it, REGISTRY_TOKEN should be # encrypted and provided via Travis CI environment # BUILD_COMMIT is your last build commit hash (git rev-parse build) yarn cozy-app-publish \\ --token $REGISTRY_TOKEN \\ --build-commit $BUILD_COMMIT Published version is inferred from the tag set on current commit or the version defined in the manifest version property: If the current commit has no tag associated, then this is a dev version in the form <manifest_version>-dev.<commit_sha><date> If the current commit has a beta tag x.y.z-beta.n or a stable tag x.y.z , then this is a beta or stable version and the tag value is used as the version Manual usage (not recommended) \u00b6 First of all, don\u2019t forget to build the application: # build the application (in the ./build folder here) yarn build Then, just publish it using: yarn cozy-app-publish \\ --token $REGISTRY_TOKEN \\ --build-url https://github.com/cozy/cozy-collect/archive/042cef26d9d33ea604fe4364eaab569980b500c9.tar.gz \\ --manual-version 1.0.2-dev.042cef26d9d33ea604fe4364eaab569980b500c9 Publishing a beta version \u00b6 Beta versions are only available through beta channel of the registry and are not automatically deployable on production instances. However a beta tester can force deployment of beta versions of a given (installed) app from Cozy store. Ask your Cozy representative to explain you how to do this. Let\u2019s say you plan to publish version 1.0.2 of your application and want to test it before publishing it to stable. Then you will publish a 1.0.2-beta.1 version, test it, publish other beta versions if some adjustement are needed and when you\u2019re satisfied with the version you will publish a stable version. To publish a beta version: Have the target stable version as the version in your manifest file (eg 1.0.2 in our example). The manifest file always reference stable version. Publish with cozy-app-publish using the beta version like 1.0.2-beta.1 yarn cozy-app-publish \\ --token $REGISTRY_TOKEN \\ --build-url https://github.com/cozy/cozy-collect/archive/042cef26d9d33ea604fe4364eaab569980b500c9.tar.gz \\ --manual-version 1.0.2-beta.1 Publishing a stable version \u00b6 Instances auto-update app versions as soon as they are published as stable. Publishing a new stable version will make it available immediately to all instances (existing and new ones) unless permission changes requiring user\u2019s validation. To publish a stable version, simply use a version in the form x.y.z and it will be considered as stable. Because manifest\u2019s version doesn\u2019t need to be changed between beta and stable, you don\u2019t need to rebuild the application and can publish the exact same app package you built for beta publication yarn cozy-app-publish \\ --token $REGISTRY_TOKEN \\ --build-url https://github.com/cozy/cozy-collect/archive/042cef26d9d33ea604fe4364eaab569980b500c9.tar.gz \\ --manual-version 1.0.2 Options \u00b6 --token <editor-token> (required) \u00b6 The registry editor token. This token must match the editor name and is provided by Cozy Cloud (with the name) in order to use the registry. --build-dir <relative-path> \u00b6 The path to the build folder, relative to the current directory. Since the \u2018standard\u2019 Cozy application builds in the build/ folder, build is the default value. This folder is mainly used to read the application manifest during publishing. --build-url <url> \u00b6 For now, the registry a build archive (.tar.gz file) from an external link to be used in the cozy-stack. In the travis script, this url is computed using the Github trick to get archives from a commit url (but it\u2019s overwritten if provided by this option). For the manual script, we have to provide it. --build-commit <commit-hash> \u00b6 Using the travis mode, the archive tarball URL is computed using github and the build commit hash. If you are not on your build branch to publish, you can specify the correct build commit hash using this parameter. --manual-version <version> (required for manual usage only) \u00b6 In the manual mode, we don\u2019t have a way to compute the version like in the Travis mode for example. So we have to provide it using this option. --prepublish <script_path> \u00b6 Specify custom prepublish hook to manage how the app archive is generated and uploaded. The script must export a asynchronous function which has the following signature: module . exports = async ({ appBuildUrl , appSlug , appType , appVersion , buildCommit , registryUrl , registryEditor , registryToken , spaceName }) => { // ... } This function must return an object containing the same options given as parameter, which can have been updated. For example, you may specifiy a new appBuildUrl in the hook. Here\u2019s a description of the different options: Options Description appBuildUrl The url where the build can be retrieved. For example, http://github.com/cozy/cozy-foo/archives/cozy-foo.tar.gz appSlug The slug of the application, as defined in the manifest. Should not be mutated appType webapp or konnector appVersion App version, as defined in the manifest. Should not be mutated. buildCommit sha of the commit, should not be mutated. registryUrl URL of the Cozy registry, should not be mutated. registryEditor Editor as it appears in the Cozy registry. registryToken Registry Token. See registry documentation . Should not be mutated. spaceName Space name in the Cozy registry. --postpublish <script_path> \u00b6 Works exactly like the prepublish option, but will be executed after the publication. Multiple hooks and built-in hooks \u00b6 You can specify more than one hook by separating them with a , : cozy-app-publish --prepublish <hook_name>,<other_hook_name> Some hooks are shipped with cozy-app-publish and can be used by specifying their name: cozy-app-publish --prepublish <builtin_hook_name> Downcloud prepublish hook \u00b6 cozy-app-publish --prepublish downcloud This hook allows to upload the app to our downcloud server and sets the appBuildUrl accordingly. In order to upload files to our downcloud server, you will need to generate a new pair of RSA keys, add the private key to your ssh-agent and make sure the corresponding public key is present on the downcloud server. Here\u2019s how to do it: Generate a new key pair with ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f id_rsa_downcloud_myapp -C downcloud_myapp_deploy . Communicate the public key to someone who can deposit it on the downcloud server. If you\u2019re running things locally, you\u2019ll want to run ssh-add id_rsa_downcloud_myapp to add it to your ssh-agent. If you\u2019re planing to run this cozy-app-publish on Travis, you\u2019ll want to encrypt that file first . Run travis encrypt-file id_rsa_downcloud_myapp and copy the output. This command also generates a id_rsa_downcloud_myapp.enc . To add the key to Travis\u2019s ssh-agent, add the following lines in the before_install section of your .travis.yml , but don\u2019t forget to paste the output of travis encrypt-file where it\u2019s needed. - if [ \"$TRAVIS_SECURE_ENV_VARS\" != \"false\" ]; then PASTE_TRAVIS_ENCRYPT_OUTPUT_HERE; fi - if [ \"$TRAVIS_SECURE_ENV_VARS\" != \"false\" ]; then eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"; fi - if [ \"$TRAVIS_SECURE_ENV_VARS\" != \"false\" ]; then chmod 600 id_rsa_downcloud_myapp; fi - if [ \"$TRAVIS_SECURE_ENV_VARS\" != \"false\" ]; then ssh-add id_rsa_downcloud_myapp; fi We recommend changing the path used for the private key. You can change the -out argument of the command output by travis encrypt-file and the corresponding path\u2019s in the commands above. /tmp/id_rsa_downcloud_myapp is a good place to store this key. You mays also change the -in argument of the same command, and change the path of the file id_rsa_downcloud_myapp.enc to whatever you want. We recomend using ./deploy/id_rsa_downcloud_myapp.enc (don\u2019t forget to move the file as well!). Finally, secure the private key . If you\u2019re using Travis, the key is now stored by Travis so you should delete your local copy. If you\u2019re running things on your machine, make sure the private key doesn\u2019t end up in version control. Mattermost postpublish hook \u00b6 cozy-app-publish --postpublish mattermost Sends a message to a mattermost channel to notify of the app\u2019s deployment. Requires the following options: MATTERMOST_HOOK_URL : You will need to set up a new Incoming Hook . MATTERMOST_CHANNEL : (optional) The name of the channel messages will be posted to or else the default channel of the hook will be used --registry-url <url> \u00b6 The url of the registry, by default it will be https://staging-apps-registry.cozycloud.cc . --space <space-name> \u00b6 Use this options to provide a specific space name of the registry to publish the application in. By default it will be published in the default space. --verbose \u00b6 To print more logs when using tool (useful for debug). Recommended workflow \u00b6 Day to day \u00b6 Development is done on feature branches that are merged into master , once they are complete. Every time someone commits on master , a new archive is created and uploaded on Downcloud and then published to Cozy Cloud registry. Release workflow \u00b6 A new release branch is created from the current state of master . Let\u2019s say we want to deploy version 1.0.0 of the app, we will create release/1.0.0 . Since we created a new branch, we have to bump the version of master , so we have to create a PR to bump to 1.1.0 everywhere it is necessary. This depends on the app, but most of the time it requires to change the package.json and manifest.webapp versions. The only type of commits allowed on this release branch are bug fixes, that should be made on the release branch. To release a stable or beta version, generally we use directly github and the release creation interface. In this interface, don\u2019t forget to fill in the changelog and to check \u201cprelease\u201d for a beta version. The title of the release must be the released version (ex.: 1.40.0-beta.1 ) Every time bugs are fixed and the version is considered for release, the latest commit is tagged with a prerelease version number, eg. 1.0.0-beta.1 , 1.0.0-beta.2 , etc\u2026 Each of these prereleases is automatically uploaded on downcloud and deployed on instances that are on the beta channel. Once the branch is deemed ready for release, the last commit is tagged with the final version \u2014 1.0.0 in our example. It is then, again, uploaded on downcloud, published on the registry and deployed on specific instances as needed. The release branch is merged back into master so that all the bugfixes aren\u2019t lost. Versions \u00b6 We apply the semver convention: If the release brings only bug fixes, then we should create a patch version. If the release brings at least one feature, then we should create a minor version. If the release changes its application\u2019s permissions, we should create a minor version even if this release is for bug fixes only. Hot Fix \u00b6 If you need to quickly fix a bug in production, then you have to: fetch the latest branch release create a new release branch from there (since this is a bug fix, this is a patch version) fix the bug Make a beta Publish Merge it on master Example: You have to hot fix Drive. The current stable version of Drive is : 1.45.0. Master is on 1.47.0.

In order to upload files to our downcloud server, you will need to generate a new pair of RSA keys, add the private key to your ssh-agent and make sure the corresponding public key is present on the downcloud server. Here\u2019s how to do it: Generate a new key pair with ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f id_rsa_downcloud_myapp -C downcloud_myapp_deploy . Communicate the public key to someone who can deposit it on the downcloud server. If you\u2019re running things locally, you\u2019ll want to run ssh-add id_rsa_downcloud_myapp to add it to your ssh-agent. If you\u2019re planing to run this cozy-app-publish on Travis, you\u2019ll want to encrypt that file first . Run travis encrypt-file id_rsa_downcloud_myapp and copy the output. This command also generates a id_rsa_downcloud_myapp.enc . To add the key to Travis\u2019s ssh-agent, add the following lines in the before_install section of your .travis.yml , but don\u2019t forget to paste the output of travis encrypt-file where it\u2019s needed. - if [ \"$TRAVIS_SECURE_ENV_VARS\" != \"false\" ]; then PASTE_TRAVIS_ENCRYPT_OUTPUT_HERE; fi - if [ \"$TRAVIS_SECURE_ENV_VARS\" != \"false\" ]; then eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"; fi - if [ \"$TRAVIS_SECURE_ENV_VARS\" != \"false\" ]; then chmod 600 id_rsa_downcloud_myapp; fi - if [ \"$TRAVIS_SECURE_ENV_VARS\" != \"false\" ]; then ssh-add id_rsa_downcloud_myapp; fi We recommend changing the path used for the private key. You can change the -out argument of the command output by travis encrypt-file and the corresponding path\u2019s in the commands above. /tmp/id_rsa_downcloud_myapp is a good place to store this key. You mays also change the -in argument of the same command, and change the path of the file id_rsa_downcloud_myapp.enc to whatever you want. We recomend using ./deploy/id_rsa_downcloud_myapp.enc (don\u2019t forget to move the file as well!). Finally, secure the private key . If you\u2019re using Travis, the key is now stored by Travis so you should delete your local copy.

The title of the release must be the released version (ex.: 1.40.0-beta.1 ) Every time bugs are fixed and the version is considered for release, the latest commit is tagged with a prerelease version number, eg. 1.0.0-beta.1 , 1.0.0-beta.2 , etc\u2026 Each of these prereleases is automatically uploaded on downcloud and deployed on instances that are on the beta channel. Once the branch is deemed ready for release, the last commit is tagged with the final version \u2014 1.0.0 in our example.

To work properly, it requires: Go >= 1.18 Couchdb >= 3.2 Redis Openstack Object Storage (Swift) How to develop with a cozy-apps-registry working in local environment \u00b6 Before starting, you will need to have a couchdb running already. That can be the one used by the local cozy-stack if you have one. For this tutorial, couchdb will be running on the default port 5984. You also must have redis and an OpenStack Object Storage (Swift) up and running. You can follow install instructions on the official website 1) Install and configure the local cozy-apps-registry \u00b6 Since this is a golang project, you can install it using go with the followed command: go get -u github.com/cozy/cozy-apps-registry cd $GOPATH /src/github.com/cozy/cozy-apps-registry/ Then you will need a session secret key to run the registry (this key will be store in the sessionsecret.key file of your working directory) using a password: cozy-apps-registry gen-session-secret --passphrase sessionsecret.key This password is important, you will need it to run the cozy-apps-registry again later. If you lose it, you will have to start again these steps. 2) Configure the registry with cozy-registry.yml \u00b6 Before running the registry, you have to configure it correctly. Don\u2019t worry, here is the yaml file to copy and paste in your cozy-registry.yml (should be in the root folder of cozy-apps-registry/ ): You can find an example of this configuration file at the root of the directory. # server host (serve command) - flag --host host : \"localhost\" # server port (serve command) - flag --port port : 8081 couchdb : # CouchDB server url - flag --couchdb-url url : http://localhost:5984 # CouchDB user - flag --couchdb-user user : '' # CouchDB password - flag --couchdb-password password : '' # CouchDB prefix for the registries databases - flag --couchdb-prefix prefix : registry1 swift : # Swift auth URL (provided by keystone) auth_url : http://172.28.128.3/identity/v3 # Swift username username : admin # Swift password api_key : secret # Endpoint type (public/admin/internal) endpointy_type : public # Project name tenant : demo # Swift domain domain : default # Path to the session secret file containing the master secret to generate # session token. # # Should be generated with the \"gen-session-secret\" command. session-secret : sessionsecret.key Feel free to change it if some configurations change in your case (the couchdb user, the server parameters or the databases prefix for example). Notices: Here the generated session token (step 1) is stored in the sessionsecret.key file of the working directory, this is so the value of the property session-secret at the end of the configuration file. By default, the local couchdb allow all admin accesses without creating users, so there is no user and password here. But if an admin user has been created, you have to use the properties user and password in the couchdb part to provide these informations. It\u2019s also possible to use env variables for configuration. You can take the key from the configuration file and add the COZY_REGISTRY prefix. For example, you can run: COZY_REGISTRY_PORT = 8081 cozy-apps-registry serve There is also the REGISTRY_SESSION_PASS env variable for the password for the session secret. 3) Run the registry to serve the apps \u00b6 Run the registry using this followed command (here our configuration file is a cozy-registry.yml in the current working directory): cozy-apps-registry serve -c cozy-registry.yml At this step, you should have a cozy-apps-registry running and ready for the development. If you runnig the registry for the first time you can see the next steps to create a new editor and to configure your local cozy-stack to run with this new registry. The -c options is always mandatory if you want to specify a config file like here. 4) Create an editor \u00b6 This step is required to submit new applications in the registry. In another terminal, run these commands to create an editor (the one that will submit the application(s)) and generate an access token: cozy-apps-registry add-editor Cozy -c cozy-registry.yml cozy-apps-registry gen-token --master Cozy -c cozy-registry.yml Here we go, you have now an registry ready and running on the 8081 port. The -c options is always mandatory if you want to specify a config file like here. 5) Configure cozy-stack with the registry \u00b6 On the cozy-stack , you have to add the new registry in the stack configuration file cozy.yaml (registries property): ... registries : default : - http://localhost:8081/ ... Now restart your local cozy-stack to take this new configuration in consideration (stop and run again cozy-stack serve ) and you\u2019re ready to work with the cozy-apps-registry ! Publish your application on the registry \u00b6 If you need more details about the registry you can go to the official registry documentation Important: In this whole documentation, by the term application , we mean a web application or a konnector. Indeed, for the registry, all entities are applications and they can be either webapp or konnector type. 1) Define your application manifest \u00b6 To be publishable, your application requires some informations in its manifest.webapp , the manifest of a Cozy application. You can find an example of manifest for an application in Cozy-Drive and one for a konnector in cozy-konnector-trainline . Most properties are common to both applications and konnectors but platforms, screenshots, services, routes and intents are only used in applications. Properties oauth, data_types, doctypes, fields, frequency, language, messages, parameters, time_interval, uuid and vendor_link ar only used in konnectors. Properties meaning (reference) \u00b6 Here are all properties meaning for the manifest file (for webapp and konnectors) sorted alphabetically: Field Description accept_from_flagship (Boolean) indicating if the app accepts receiving files from our Flagship application. See Accept from Flagship documentation. accept_documents_from_flagship an object defining properties of accepted files when accept_from_flagship is true . See Accept from Flagship documentation. aggregator Object containing aggregator data. Typically { accountId: 'aggregator-service' } . categories array of categories for your apps (see authorized categories), it will be ['others'] by default if empty data_types (konnector specific) Array of the data type the konnector will manage developer name and url for the developer editor the editor\u2019s name to display on the cozy-bar ( REQUIRED ) fields (konnector specific) JSON object describing the fields need by the konnector ( except folder path ). Used to generate a form. See below folders (konnector specific) A list of folders required by the konnector to store files according to datatype (see the specific documentation below ) frequency (konnector specific) A human readable value between monthly , weekly , daily , hourly , indicating the interval of time between two runs of the konnector. Default: weekly . icon path to the icon for the home (path in the build) intents (application specific) a list of intents provided by this app (see cozy-stack intents doc for more details) langs Languages available in your app (can be different from locales) language (konnector specific) the konnector development language used (ex: node ) license the SPDX license identifier locales an object with language slug as property, each name property is an object of localized informations (see the second part below) manifest_version The current manifest version used. This is a versioning for the manifest and allow better retrocompatiblity when processing app manifest messages (konnector specific) Array of message identifiers, which can be used by application to display information at known areas. See example below . mobile (application specific) JSON object containing information about app\u2019s mobile version (see cozy-stack routes doc for more details) name the name to display on the home ( REQUIRED ) name_prefix the prefix to display with the name notifications an object defining how the application can notify the user. See Notifications documentation. oauth (konnector specific) JSON object containing oAuth information, like scope . If a manifest provides an oauth property, it is considered as an OAuth konnector. Note: scope can be a string or an array. If it is an array, its values will be joined with a space. A false or null value in scope will remove any scope parameter in the request sent to the oauth provider. offline_support (Boolean) indicating if the app supports Offline mode when opened from our Flagship application. See Flagship Offline mode documentation parameters (konnector specific) Additional parameters which should be passed to the konnector. Used for example for bank konnectors to pass a bankId parameter. partnership an object to provide informations (to display in the Store for example) about a partnership related to the application ( icon description , name and domain ). It can also be used to trigger alternative konnector connection policies for some vendors (see the budget-insight konnector policy in cozy-harvest ). permissions a map of permissions needed by the app (see see cozy-stack permissions doc for more details) platforms (application specific) List of objects for platform native applications. For now there are only two properties: type (i.e. 'ios' or 'linux' ) and the optional url to reach this application page. routes (application specific) a map of routes for the app (see cozy-stack routes doc for more details) ( REQUIRED ) screenshots an array of paths to the screenshots of the application (paths in the build) services (application specific) a map of the services associated with the app (see cozy-stack services doc for more details) slug the default slug that should never change (alpha-numeric lowercase) ( REQUIRED ) source where the files of the app can be downloaded (by default it will look for the branch build ) terms an object defining properties for terms that need to be displayed/accepted by the user when installing the application ( more-info-below ) time_interval (konnector specific) By defaults, konnector triggers are scheduled randomly between 00:00 AM and 05:00 AM. Those two values can be overwritten thanks to this property, by passing an array containing two values: first is the interval start hour, second is the interval end hour. Example: [15, 21] will randomly schedule the konnector trigger between 15:00 (03:00 PM) and 21:00 (09:00 PM). The time zone used is GMT. type type of application ( konnector or webapp ) ( REQUIRED ) version the current version number ( REQUIRED ) vendor_link (konnector specific) URL to editor or service website qualification_labels (konnector specific) Array of one or more labels from the Cozy Client\u2019s qualifications list to associate with the files the konnector will receive from the website. features (konnector specific) Array of features added in the konnector from the list below. Available manifest\u2019s features list : \u00b6 2FA Two Factors identification. BILLS Import bills documents, doctype \u201cio.cozy.bills\u201d. FILES Import files documents, doctype \u201cio.cozy.files\u201d. CAPTCHA_RESOLUTION The konnector using a captcha resolution process. CARBON_COPY The konnector import legally true copy of the original files. DOC_QUALIFICATION The konnector uses the first version of files qualifications, you may stumble upon on some konnectors wich hasn\u2019t been treated. DOC_QUALIFICATION_V2 The konnector uses new version (last one for now) of files qualifications. ELECTRONIC_SAFE Files comes from a known electronic safe. HEALTH The konnector treat health documents HTML_TO_PDF The konnector needs to convert HTML page(s) to make pdf files. IDENTITY The konnector create identity(ies) for doctype \u201cio.cozy.identities\u201d LOGIN_OK The konnector deactivate the auto-notification METADATA_DEDUP The konnector uses a fileIdAttribute as detection to avoid deduplication. VENDOR_REF The konnector uses. SENTRY_V2 The konnector had been migrated (or packaged) to sentry V2 (errors.cozycloud.cc) Notices: All images paths ( icon , partnership.icon and screenshots ) should be relative to the build directory. For example, here, the icon.svg is stored in the build root directory and all screenshots are store in a folder screenshots in the build directory. Therefore, if you use a bundler (like webpack) be sure to know exactly where the bundler will store these assets in the build directory (and change it in the manifest if needed). All properties in locales objects will override the matched property of the main manifest.webapp body, if a property is not found in locales it will fallback to the main body one. We use to have the en locale as default one if the one wanted by the user doesn\u2019t exist. Be sure to have, at least, that locale complete with the name and all descriptions. In your build files, this manifest.webapp file must be at the root. Translated manifest fields \u00b6 Here are the properties that you can override using locales (we recommand to automatically build these properties according to your locales files if you\u2019re using a translating tool like transifex ): name , the app\u2019s name short_description , short description of what the app do long_description , longer and more complete description of the app behaviour changes , description of your new version of the konnector or all changes since the last version fields , An object containing translations for fields. screenshots folders { \"fields\" : { \"email\" : { \"type\" : \"email\" } }, \"locales\" : { \"en\" : { \"short_description\" : \"Collect your Orange's bills\" , \"fields\" : { \"email\" : { \"label\" : \"Identifier (your email)\" } } }, \"fr\" : { \"short_description\" : \"R\u00e9cup\u00e8re vos factures Orange\" , \"fields\" : { \"email\" : { \"label\" : \"Identifiant (votre adresse mail)\" } } } } } Application terms \u00b6 You can provide a related terms property if you want to display and make the user accept some terms (ToS for example) just before installing the application. Here are all properties allowed and used: url , the URL of the terms/contract to redirect the user to ( REQUIRED ) version : A specific version of the terms, we need it handle terms updates and ask the user again to accept the update. The special characters [*+~.()'\"!:@] are not allowed here. ( REQUIRED ) id : An id for the terms. When accepting terms, we store in io.cozy.terms , a document containing the id and version so that we know which terms have been accepted, and show the user a modal if the terms have not been accepted yet. The special characters [*+~.()'\"!:@] are not allowed here. ( REQUIRED ) Konnectors folders handling \u00b6 The folders property is a list of objects with these following properties: defaultDir : ( REQUIRED ) The default root directory of your folder. In this folder will automatically be created a subfolder with the konnector name and into this latter a subfolder with the account name to store the related files. Here you can use some variables in the path like the following: $administrative : Folder which will receive all administrative related files (bills, contracts, invoices\u2026) $photos : Folder which will receive all photos $konnector : The name of the konnector All paths provided using defaultDir will be the root directory, not the final folder which will receive the files. For example, if you set $photos , the final folder will be $photos/$konnector/$account in order to keep them always sorted by konnectors and accounts. Konnectors fields property \u00b6 The fields property is a JSON object describing the input fields needed to generate the konnector\u2019s configuration form. A typical example will be: { \"fields\" : { \"identifier\" : { \"type\" : \"text\" }, \"secret\" : { \"type\" : \"password\" } } } The keys of the fields object are the name/id of the fields. They will be passed as parameters to the konnector at every run. Each fields may also have the following properties: Property Description identifier (Boolean) indicating if the field is the main identifier. By default, the login field is the identifier. Default value is false and there can be only one identifier advanced Indicates if the field should be displayed in the \u201cadvanced\u201d area of the form (default: false ) default Default value. It can a string for a text field, or an object for a select field ( \"default\": {\"value\": \"foo\",\"name\": \"bar\"}, ) description Field description, as a locale key. label Predefined label. This value must match a locale key provided by Cozy-Home. Example: With label: \"identifier\" , Cozy-Home will use the locale key account.form.label.identifier . Translations for these fields use the locales property in the manifest. max Maximum length of the value (number of characters) min Minimum length of the value (number of characters) options When the field is a dropdown, list of available options pattern Define a regex used to validate the field. isRequired Boolean indicating if the field is required or not (default true ) type Required . Field type from dropdown , email , hidden , password , text , checkbox . Konnectors message property \u00b6 Messages are a common way to provide custom information to display in application. An app like cozy-home should have some specific area to display custom messages provided by the konnector. Example: // The final example will be available after the implementation of the whole mechanism, // but here is the global idea: { installSuccess && < p >{ t ( 'home.konnector.install.success.message' )}</ p > } { installSuccess && konnector . manifest . messages . includes ( 'success_message' ) && < p >{ t ( 'konnector.manifest.locales.messages.success_message' )} } Categories and Data types \u00b6 Categories are slugs from the following list: banking clouds cozy education energy finance health host_provider insurance isp mes_infos online_services partners press pro productivity ptnb public_service shopping social tech telecom transport Data types are slugs from the following list: activity appointment bankTransactions bankAccounts bill bloodPressure calendar certificate commit consumption contact contract courseMaterial document event family geopoint heartbeat home phonecommunicationlog podcast profile refund sinister sleepTime stepsNumber temperature travelDate tweet videostream weight 2) Add a new application in the registry \u00b6 Our official apps registry \u00b6 Official registry URL: https://apps-registry.cozycloud.cc In order to use our official repository, you need a token for a specific editor. To do so, contact us directly at the address contact@cozycloud.cc with a mail using the following title prefix: [registry] and provide us these folowing information (not changeable after): - slug of your application - editor name that you want We will provide you with the correct token. Custom registry \u00b6 See the details below to know how to add a new application in a custom cozy-apps-registry instance (local or not). Prequisites : - For this step, you will need your editor token access generated when you created your editor (see below ). You have to replace all {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} in this documentation by this token. - The communication with the registry is done through HTTP requests for now. So we will use the curl command line tool to register our application here. Now you can add your application in the registry. This step is splitted in two septs: - Add a new application (without versions) - Add a version of the application A new application without registered version won\u2019t be displayed by the cozy-store application . To add a new application, you have to do a POST request which all the informations needed to the route registryAddress/registry with registryAddress your registry address (for example here http://localhost:8081 ). Let\u2019s add the Collect application as example: # {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} -> your generated editor access token curl -X \"POST\" \"http://localhost:8081/registry\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Token {{EDITOR_TOKEN}}\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d $'{ \"slug\": \"collect\", \"type\": \"webapp\", \"editor\": \"{{EDITOR}}\" }' Field Description slug your application unique ID type kind of application (it can be only webapp or konnector ) editor Name of the editor matching the {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} Here the slug is the unique ID of the application in the registry, so it can\u2019t be changed after the application is already registered. 3) Add a new version of a registered application \u00b6 Please note that an application bundle cannot be larger than 20MB (hardcoded value). This limitation has been implemented to encourage better web application development practices because in general the larger the application bundle is, the worst the performance and user experience will be. Via cozy-app-publish (highly recommanded) \u00b6 Here we will show the classical way to add a version using the manual mode of cozy-app-publish as reference. But you may need to look at the Automation CI part of this documentation instead. Prequisites : For this step, you will need your editor token access generated when you created your editor (see below ). You have to replace all {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} in this documentation by this token. Don\u2019t forget to build your application first (run yarn build ), cozy-app-publish will read the manifest from your build Firstly, install the cozy-app-publish package using yarn or npm : yarn add cozy-app-publish --dev You can also install the package as a global package, but don\u2019t forget to update it frequently Then use it to publish your application, here is an example for collect : yarn cozy-app-publish \\ --token {{ EDITOR_TOKEN }} \\ --build-url https://github.com/cozy/cozy-collect/archive/042cef26d9d33ea604fe4364eaab569980b500c9.tar.gz \\ --manual-version 1.0.2-dev.042cef26d9d33ea604fe4364eaab569980b500c9 If you need more information about this tool, you can go to the official cozy-app-publish documentation . Via curl \u00b6 Here we will show the classical way to add a version using curl as reference. But you may need to look at our dedicated tool cozy-app-publish or the Automation CI part of this documentation instead. Prequisites : - For this step, you will need your editor token access generated when you created your editor (see below ). You have to replace all {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} in this documentation by this token. - The communication with the registry is done through HTTP requests for now. So we will use the curl command line tool to register our application here. To add a new version for a registered application, you have to do a POST request with all needed information to the route registryAddress/registry/:appSlug to publish in default space or registryAddress/:space/registry/:appSlug for a named space (see Spaces & Virtual Spaces below) with registryAddress your registry address (for example here http://localhost:8081 ), :appName your application slug (here drive ) and :space your registry space. Let\u2019s add the version 1.0.1 of the Collect application for example: # {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} -> your generated editor access token curl -X \"POST\" \"http://localhost:8081/registry/collect\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Token {{EDITOR_TOKEN}}\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d $'{ \"url\": \"https://github.com/cozy/cozy-collect/archive/1.0.1.tar.gz\", \"sha256\": \"96212bf53ab618808da0a92c7b6d9f2867b1f9487ba7c1c29606826b107041b5\", \"version\": \"1.0.1\", }' Field Description url the archive source of your application, it will be downloaded and checked with the sha256 property sha256 the sha256 hash of your source archive matching the archive in url (see the notice below) version version of the application, must match the one in the manifest (see the notice below) Important notices: The version must match the one in the manifest.webapp file for stable release. For beta (X.X.X-betaX) or dev releases (X.X.X-dev.hash256), the version before the cyphen must match the one in the manifest.webapp . If version starts with the v letter (like v1.2.3 ), then the v letter is silently stripped from version, allowing you to simply publish according to tag name if your tags are labelled vx.y.z . For better integrity, the sha256 provided must match the sha256 of the archive provided in url . If it\u2019s not the case, that will be considered as an error and the version won\u2019t be registered. Spaces & Virtual Spaces \u00b6 Spaces \u00b6 You can divide your applications between several isolated places, called spaces . When an application and its versions are published in a space , they are only reachable in that one (you can consider a space like a entire sub-part of the registry). It is espacially useful for splitting up applications by logical topics. Most of the CLI and API endpoints have a space option. You can refer to the documentation or CLI help to view all available parameters. Create a space \u00b6 Spaces are defined in the config file and are automatically created during registry launching. Add a space entry, followed by your spaces names, and let the registry do the work: spaces : __default__ myspace foospace Remove a space \u00b6 To remove a space, you have to clean all the remaining apps & versions before removing the space entry name. A CLI is available for the job: $ cozy-apps-registry rm-space <your-space> Example: $ cozy-apps-registry rm-space foobar Warning: You are going to remove space foobar and all its applications. This action is irreversible. Please enter the space name to confirm: foobar Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.f26bf2b8db3da459071a074a1367ce36e78bb34c Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.cf1efba4c1b6dd08bb5857f5752790f0d2663d6d Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.0bbd57a6ce50af82cfbefb8c231fbfe04516e742 Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.21338229a0c2317dc0f3b94e92b22a367f84c537 Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.08ab3624136fb70dc996003aebc3049af51f7438 Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.4e9d174a3b01acaf8a44b561455efc3f34871142 Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.b2654bf00be393aa611fcbb7f70a8ef671895a84 Removing app1/0.7.3-dev.860861868a5dfe294c7120d81fa9feb5387bb57f Removing app2/0.1.9-dev.954dac9e12e080d591cb76591c311611fed1bea9 You can now delete the name from your config file. Virtual Spaces \u00b6 A virtual space is necessarily built over an existing space . It allows to filter by selecting or rejecting applications available on the underlying space. Please note that it is not possible to publish applications or versions on a virtual space . It is possible to change the name of an application in the virtual space, without changing it in the underlying space, with the cozy-apps-registry overwrite-app-name command. The same thing is possible for the icon with cozy-apps-registry overwrite-app-icon . And the maintenance status can also be changed in the virtual space with the cozy-apps-registry maintenance commands. That\u2019s all for the moment. Automation (CI) \u00b6 The following tutorial explains how to connect your continuous integration based on Travis to automatically publish new versions on the apps registry. In this tutorial, we assume: you have a token allowing you to publish applications for your editor : {{EDITOR_TOKEN}} you are working on a repository plugged on travis and named on github myname/cozy-example You first need to add the token to your travis configuration file .travis.yml . To do so, you need the travis utility to encrypt its value. $ travis encrypt REGISTRY_TOKEN ={{ EDITOR_TOKEN }} -r myname/cozy-example --org Please add the following to your .travis.yml file: secure: \"jUAjk..LOOOOONG_ENCRYPTED_STRING.....jdk89=\" Like said, you need to add this block of ciphered data in the .travis.yml (if it\u2019s not already done automatically). This will allow you to use the REGISTRY_TOKEN variable in your deployment script. Then, you can add the publish script in your package.json in order to be used by Travis: ... \"publish:cozy\" : \"git fetch origin ${DEPLOY_BRANCH:-build}:${DEPLOY_BRANCH:-build} && cozy-app-publish --token $REGISTRY_TOKEN --build-commit $(git rev-parse ${DEPLOY_BRANCH:-build})\" ... This script will fetch your last commit from the build branch to publish to the registry. If you push a tag, be sure to wait the last build branch Travis build finished in order to have the real last commit to publish. Finally, you can add this script to your .travis.yml to publish your app using our publishing tool cozy-app-publish during the deploy process: ... before_deploy: - yarn add cozy-app-publish deploy: - provider: script repo: myname/cozy-example skip-cleanup: true script: export DEPLOY_BRANCH=build && yarn deploy && yarn publish:cozy on: branch: master - provider: script repo: myname/cozy-example skip-cleanup: true script: export DEPLOY_BRANCH=build && yarn publish:cozy on: tags: true ... Important notices: A commit push to the branch master will publish your application in the dev channel of the registry. A tag push (Github release) will publish a stable version (ex: 1.0.0 ) or a beta version (ex: 1.0.1-beta2 ) to the registry (automatically handled by the registry). cozy-app-publish will use the github archive URL computing to get the application tarball. If your applicaiton is not on Github, you may need to use the manual mode of the command. Access control and tokens \u00b6 The read-only routes of the registry are all public and do not require any access-control. However routes allowing to create applications and versions have access-control policies associated to them. The registry has two types of access permissions, that are associated to two different tokens: editor tokens : these tokens give access to the publication of new versions on the registry, for a specific editor name, at these conditions: the version\u2019s application must already exist in the registry the version\u2019s application must have the same \u201ceditor\u201d value as the token master tokens : these tokens are allowed to create and register new applications on the registry, and associate them with an existing editor name. They also have the same accesses as the editor tokens. Editor tokens can be specific to one or more applications names that they are allowed to publish. In order to create tokens, the binary offers a gen-token command-line. Here are some examples to illustrates some usages: # Generating tokens # generate an editor token for the editor \"cozy\", for any application $ cozy-apps-registry gen-token cozy # generate an editor token for the editor \"cozy\" expiring after 30 days $ cozy-apps-registry gen-token cozy --max-age 30d # generate an editor token for the editor \"cozy\" for application \"collect\" and \"drive\" $ cozy-apps-registry gen-token cozy --apps collect,drive # generate a master token associated with the editor \"cozy\" expiring after 30 days $ cozy-apps-registry gen-token cozy --master --max-age 30d # Verifying tokens # verify the editor token \"XXX\" for the editor \"cozy\" $ cozy-apps-registry verify-token cozy \"XXX\" # verify the master token \"XXX\" associated with the editor \"cozy\" $ cozy-apps-registry verify-token cozy \"XXX\" --master # Revoking tokens # revoke all editors tokens for the cozy editor $ cozy-apps-registry revoke-tokens cozy # revoke all master tokens associated with the cozy editor $ cozy-apps-registry revoke-tokens cozy --master Maintenance \u00b6 In order to set/unset an application into maintenance mode, the binary offers a maintenance command-line. Here are some examples of how to use it: # Activate maintenance mode for the application 'bank' of space 'myspace' # Available flagged options: # --infra specify a maintenance specific to our infra # --no-manual-exec specify a maintenance disallowing manual execution # --short specify a short maintenance $ cozy-apps-registry maintenance activate bank --space myspace # Deactivate maintenance mode for the application 'bank' of space 'myspace' $ cozy-apps-registry maintenance deactivate bank --space myspace Or using a cURL request and a master token: curl -XPUT \\ -H \"Authorization: Token $COZY_REGISTRY_ADMIN_TOKEN \" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"flag_infra_maintenance\": false,\"flag_short_maintenance\": false,\"flag_disallow_manual_exec\": false,\"messages\": {\"fr\": {\"long_message\": \"Bla bla bla\",\"short_message\": \"Bla\"},\"en\": {\"long_message\": \"Yadi yadi yada\",\"short_message\": \"Yada\"}}}' \\ https://apps-registry.cozycloud.cc/myspace/registry/maintenance/bank/activate curl -XPUT \\ -H \"Authorization: Token $COZY_REGISTRY_ADMIN_TOKEN \" \\ https://apps-registry.cozycloud.cc/registry/maintenance/bank/deactivate Import/export \u00b6 CouchDB & Swift can be exported into a single archive with cozy-apps-registry export <dump.tar.gz> . Registry data are exported as below: registry/couchdb/{db}/{uuid}.json : CouchDB document exported as JSON registry/swift/{file/path} : Swift document, with the following tar custom metadata COZY.content-type : associated content type The generated archive can be imported with cozy-apps-registry import -d <dump.tar.gz> . The -d option will drop CouchDB databases and Swift containers related to declared spaces on the registry configuration. Application confidence grade / labelling \u00b6 The confidence grade of an applications can be specified by specifying the data_usage_commitment and data_usage_commitment_by fields of the application document. Possible values for these properties are: data_usage_commitment : specify a technical commitment from the application editor: user_ciphered : technical commitment that the user\u2019s data is encrypted and can only be known by him. user_reserved : commitment that the data is only used for the user, to directly offer its service. none : no commitment data_usage_commitment_by : specify what entity is taking the commitment: cozy : the commitment is taken by cozy editor : the commitment is taken by the application\u2019s editor none : no commitment is taken To do that, a command line and admin API are available, and be used as follow: $ cozy-apps-registry modify-app banks --space my_space --data-usage-commitment user_reserved --data-usage-commitment-by editor Or using a cURL request and a master token: curl -XPATCH \\ -H\"Authorization: Token $COZY_REGISTRY_ADMIN_TOKEN\" \\ -H\"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d'{\"data_usage_commitment\": \"user_reserved\", \"data_usage_commitment_by\": \"editor\"} https://apps-registry.cozycloud.cc/my_space/registry/banks Universal links \u00b6 The registry can manage Universal links . Configuration \u00b6 Config file \u00b6 Each space holds its own files. The space determination is based on the request host, so you must bind a domain to a space in the config file. domain_space : mycloud.com : \"__default__\" cloud.foobar.com : \"foobar\" Files \u00b6 Place your files (e.g apple-app-site-association ) in the space container. The file must be prepended with universallink/ For the foobar space and file apple-app-site-association , the file has to be named universallink/apple-app-site-association and placed in the foobar container Usage \u00b6 The following endpoint is available to get any file: http://<yourdomain>/.well-known/:filename You can now query your endpoint to get your file: curl -X GET http://cloud.foobar.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association { \"applinks\" : { \"apps\" : [] , \"details\" : [ { \"appID\" : \"3AKXFMV43J.io.cozy.drive.mobile\" , \"paths\" : [ \"/drive\" ] } , { \"appID\" : \"3AKXFMV43J.io.cozy.banks.mobile\" , \"paths\" : [ \"/banks\" ] } , { \"appID\" : \"3AKXFMV43J.io.cozy.photos.mobile\" , \"paths\" : [ \"/photos\" ] } ] } } Budget-Insight web auth \u00b6 For some banks integration (Paypal, Orange Bank, Revolut\u2026), Budget-Insight need something similar to universal link because they expect a static domain for fallback but there is a specific domain per Cozy instance. In contrast with universal links, query parameters (provided by BI) are propagated to the final fallback redirection. http://<registry-domain>/biwebauth?fallback=http%3A%2F%2Fa.cozy%3Ffoo%3Dfoo&bar=bar redirect to http://a.cozy?foo=foo&bar=bar , merging fallback provided query parameters ( foo=foo ) with webauth provided ones ( bar=bar ).

matching algorithm is in charge of finding matchings between io.cozy.bills and io.cozy.bank.operations documents. This document explains how the matching algorithm works. What are matchings? \u00b6 Matchings are links that can be made between io.cozy.bills and io.cozy.bank.operations documents. For example, if the user ordered something on Amazon, his Amazon connector will import a io.cozy.bills document representing this order, and his banking connector will import a io.cozy.bank.operations representing the bank transaction associated to this order. In banks\u2019 UI, it is used to show a CTA with the transaction on which the user can click to show the linked bill PDF without leaving banks app. The Linker \u00b6 The algorithm is held by the Linker , and more precisely its linkBillsToOperations method. This method takes 3 parameters: An array of io.cozy.bills objects An array of io.cozy.bank.operations objects An options object The options object can contain the following properties: amountLowerDelta : defaults to 0.001 amountUpperDelta : defaults to 0.001 dateLowerDelta : defaults to 15 (days) dateUpperDelta : defaults to 29 (days) These options will determine the default date and amount windows in which a transaction should be to match with a bill. General flow \u00b6 When called, this method will do the following (each part will be explained in details after): Filter bills that are declared as third party payer: these bills have no matching transation since it has been paid by somebody else Then for each bill: Try to find a matching debit transaction (amount < 0) Try to find a matching credit transaction (amount > 0) if the bill is a refund Try to combine bills that didn\u2019t match anything to see if they match something when combined Update transactions that matched in database Finding debit and credit operations for a bill \u00b6 The algorithm is globally the same to find a debit or a credit operation for a bill, but there are some differences at some steps. Each step is explained below. Find neighboring transactions \u00b6 First, we look for transactions that are \u00ab neighbors \u00bb of the bill. It means the ones that fits in the amount and date windows of the bill. The date window is [bill date - dateLowerDelta; bill date + dateUpperDelta] . Where: bill date is bill.date if we are looking for a credit; bill.originalDate with a fallback on bill.date if we are looking for a debit dateLowerDelta is bill.matchingCriterias.dateLowerDelta if it exists, options.dateLowerDelta otherwise dateUpperDelta is bill.matchingCriterias.dateUpperDelta if it exists, options.dateUpperDelta otherwise The amount window is [bill amount - amountLowerDelta; bill amount + amountUpperDelta] . Where: bill amount is bill.groupAmount with a fallback on bill.amount if we are looking for a credit; -bill.originalAmount with a fallback on -bill.amount if we are looking for a debit amountLowerDelta is bill.matchingCriterias.amountLowerDelta if it exists, options.minAmoutDelta otherwise amountUpperDelta is bill.matchingCriterias.amountUpperDelta if it exists, options.maxAmoutDelta otherwise All transactions that matches these two criterias are kept. Apply filters to neighboring transactions \u00b6 There are other filters a transaction must pass to match with a bill. Category \u00b6 Health bills are a little special because they can only match with health transactions. So if the bill is an health bill, we keep only health transactions. Otherwise, we keep all but health transactions. You can pass a allowUncategorized option to the algorithm, in which case uncategorized transactions will also be able to match bills. Reimbursements \u00b6 This filter is applied only if we are looking for a debit transactions. If we try to link a bill as a reimbursement to a debit transaction, we check that the bill\u2019s amount and transaction\u2019s reimbursements sum does not overflows the transaction\u2019s amount. Label regex \u00b6 This filter is applied only if we are looking for a credit transaction or if the bill is not of health type. This filter checks if a transaction matches a regex that is built upon the bill\u2019s properties. Here is how the regexp is built: If the bill has a matchingCriterias.labelRegex property, this is used Otherwise we try to get the brand corresponding to the bill\u2019s vendor in our brands dictionary . If it exists, we use its regexp property Otherwise, we create a regexp containing the bill\u2019s vendor Lastly, if the bill has no vendor, we can\u2019t do anything and the filter will be false for every transaction and the bill will not match any transaction Sort remaining transactions \u00b6 A score is given to the remaining transactions according to their \u00ab distance \u00bb to the bill\u2019s date and amount. The closest one wins and continues through the algorithm. Link bills to debit and credit transactions \u00b6 When transactions were found for a given bill, we need to link the bill to them, either as a bill or as a reimbursement . When a bill matched with a transaction (debit or credit), it is added to the transaction\u2019s bills array. When a bill matched with a debit and a credit transactions, it is also added to the debit transaction\u2019s reimbursements array. A last safety net is applied by checking if adding the bill to the transaction would make the bills sum overflowing the transaction amount or not. It it overflows, the bill is not added. For the bills property, a removed bill will be ignored. But for the reimbursements property, since we don\u2019t fetch the bill because the amount is already present in the transaction, a removed bill will not be ignored. Bills combinations \u00b6 Sometimes, bills need to be combined to match with a debit transaction. It is generally the case for health bills. For example, when your paid multiple medical procedures with a single transaction. It will generate multiple bills for a single debit transaction. In this case, we try to combine bills and find debit transaction for them. This combination process is not required to find debit transaction because in that case the bill\u2019s groupAmount (see io.cozy.bills documentation ) can be used. The bills that are candidates to be combined are the ones that: Didn\u2019t match with a debit transaction Are health costs or are from a vendor that groups bills These bills are then grouped by date and vendor, so we don\u2019t mix bills that have nothing in common. Then all possible combinations are generated for each group. For each combination, a \u00ab meta bill \u00bb is created from the grouped bills and this meta bill is passed in the matching algorithm to find a debit transaction that matches with it. If a transaction is found, then all the bills making the meta bill are linked to it using the same logic as before.", "title": "Bills/transactions matching algorithm"}, {"location": "cozy-banks/docs/bills-matching/#billstransactions-matching-algorithm", "text": "The matching algorithm is in charge of finding matchings between io.cozy.bills and io.cozy.bank.operations documents.

Doctypes used in Banks \u00b6 Accounts: io.cozy.bank.accounts Groups: io.cozy.bank.groups Accounts and groups are loaded right away and are necessary for most of the pages in Banks. No particular strategy for them is necessary since their general cardinality is low (a user has typically less than 100 accounts/groups). It is necessary for example to load account and groups to show the correct transactions when filter the transactions by account / group. Recurrence bundles: io.cozy.bank.recurrence Recurrence bundles are loaded on the recurrences page and could benefit from pagination if a user a more than 100 recurrence bundle. For the recurrence page where transactions pertaining to a particular recurrence bundle are shown, only its transactions are loaded. Triggers: io.cozy.triggers Necessary to display how fresh is the data for a particular account. Used in the balance page and the settings page. Transactions: io.cozy.bank.operations Transactions is the doctype with the highest cardinality and a user has typically several thousands of transactions. A banking transaction weigh less than a 1ko, but a user with 10 years of banking history with a mean of 3 transactions per days as 20000 transactions; in this case several Mo should be downloaded if we had stayed with querying all transactions at each page reload. This is why granular queries were implemented so that each page only loads what is necessary for its needs. Transactions fetching \u00b6 Since it is not performant to load all the transactions from a user at load, queries fetching a subset of the transactions are used. Filtering / indexing and paginated queries through fetchMore are used. Balances page \u00b6 On the balance page, we need account/groups and the transactions for the last year to draw the chart. Transactions are loaded with a subset of their fields so as to lower the data transmitted: only amount, account, date and currency are loaded. Transactions are fetched in batch of 1000 until no more data has been loaded. This is why if a user has more than 1000 transactions in the last year, the graph will be updated for each round of 1000 transactions being fetched. Transaction page \u00b6 The transaction query is based on the account/group filter to only fetch transactions pertaining to a group/account When the user jump from month to month, new queries are created that start at the selected month. This prevents easy infinite top scrolling since we cannot do fetchMore in reverse but this has been deemed OK functionally since the user can use the arrows after reaching the top Infinite fetching when reaching the bottom is implemented via the fetchMore function. Since we do not want data from other months to disturb one particular month, queries on the transactions pages are created with the query options { add: false }. This prevents transactions that have been fetched through the january query to end ud in the march query. This would prevent the infinite loading mechanism to work correctly (since we rely on a graphical element to trigger the fetchMore). Here are the different transaction queries that are made transactions-<accountId> : transactions for a particular account when the user has not yet navigated in time. Transactions are fetched sorted by date, so we end up with the most recent transactions for a particular account. When the user scrolls down and we have more transactions (query.hasMore), we can request more transactions through query.fetchMore transactions-<accountId>-<endDate> When the user navigates from month to month via the date selector, we create a new query that contains the ending month ({ date: { $gt: endDate }}). This enables us to support the infinite loading through the previous mechanism of fetchMore. transactions-<groupId> When the user selects a group. Very similar to the transactions-<accountId> query but we fetch transactions for several accounts with a CouchDB $in query on the account attribute. transactions-<groupId>-<endDate> Similar to the transactions-<accountId>-endDate> , this is when the user has filtered by a group and has navigated to a month via the date selector. Date selector \u00b6 For the date selector to show the right available options, we need to have the full extent of dates that is available for the particular account/group that we have chosen. Here, we make 2 queries, one for the earliest transaction and one for the latest transaction and then we generate all the months between those two transactions to display the date selector options. Those queries are indexed by date and account and are quick (30ms). While those queries are in flight, the date selector is displayed but not functional. Categories page \u00b6 For this page, we do not need to support infinite loading since we stay in 1 particular month/year. Thus we end up with queries like transactions-<accountId/groupId>-<startDate>-<endDate> = queries only for the current month transactions, filtered by account and group. useFullyLoadedQuery is used to load all the documents via fetchMore since it is necessary to have all the docs to make aggregate statistics on them.

If you don\u2019t, please check the official documentation and follow the instructions to install it on your system. Then you can install the dependencies: $ yarn Install the fixtures: $ yarn fixtures Build the app: $ yarn build And running the app: $ yarn start Please note that for the project to work, you will need to have a working cozy-stack. See how to run a cozy application for more information. When watching, you still need to have a cozy-stack running to serve the files of the app (do not use the webpack-dev-server directly). This is important as the stack injects through template variables the token and domain used to connect to the cozy. \u26a0\ufe0f CSPs must be disabled when working with the development server (as the index.html is served via the stack but the JS assets are served via webpack-dev-server). You can do this via a browser extension ( Chrome ) or you can tell the stack to disable CSPs via its config file ( disable_csp: true , check here for more info on the config file). See an example config file here . Fixtures \u00b6 While developing, it is convenient to be able to inject and remove arbitrary data on your local instance. You can add fixtures by installing ACH globally and using data from test/fixtures . We have a set of fake banking data in the test/fixtures/demo.json file that you can inject in your instance using the yarn fixtures command. If you want to inject other data or remove some data, you can use ACH . Doctypes \u00b6 The doctypes used in Banks are described in the cozy-doctypes repository. Continuous build \u00b6 The application is built automatically and published on Cozy Registry by Travis . Release \u00b6 A release consists in publishing the app on all platforms: web (via the Cozy Registry ), Android (via the Google Play Store, APKs are also linked to Github releases ) and iOS (via the App Store). Start a release branch \u00b6 When starting a release, start the checklist PR with: yarn release This will ask for the next version number and create a release branch with it. If you have Hub installed (recommended), it will also create the related pull request for you. Workflow \u00b6 When a release branch is created, features are frozen and the branch should only receive bugfixes. To create beta versions, you have to do two things: Commit it and create a tag with the X.Y.Z-beta.M scheme (for example 1.5.0-beta.1 ) and push them The web app beta version will be automatically built and published on the cozy registry. An APK for Android will also be automatically created. For iOS, you have to build the app and upload it on Testflight. Publish manually on the Cozy registry \u00b6 To publish manually on the Cozy registry, you need a token also stored in Cozy internal password store : export REGISTRY_TOKEN=`pass registry/spaces/banks/banks.token` After, you can use cozy-app-publish to push the app to the registry. More information : https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack/blob/master/docs/registry-publish.md Notifications \u00b6 How to develop on templates \u00b6 With the TEST_TEMPLATES environment variable, an express server serving the HTML emails will be built. $ env TEST_TEMPLATES = true yarn watch:services $ node build/testTemplates.js Rendering emails at http://localhost:8081! You can open your browser to check the emails. The Preview feature in Mailchimp is also useful to check that everything is correctly rendered on the various email clients (just copy/paste the content of the page). Under the covers \u00b6 The templates are Handlebars templates using the mjml language. mjml greatly reduces the pains to develop an email template as it deals with a lot of quirks for you. It features ready-made components to make responsive email templates. Behind the scene, it uses React to implement custom components, and juice to inline the CSS into the HTML. The handlebars-layouts plugin is used to provide an easy way to extend a base template (\u00e0 la jinja ) Other templates : nodemon --exec \"node transactions-notification.js\" -e js,css,hbs,json Assets \u00b6 Assets in assets/ are uploaded to https://downcloud.cozycloud.cc on every deployment on CI. It can also be done manually with the yarn uploadStaticFiles script. Debug notification triggers \u00b6 To debug notifications, you have to launch a watch on the notifications.js and then launch it with cozy-run-dev . \u26a0\ufe0f You have to temporarily add io.cozy.accounts to your manifest so that you can create a dev account to test the service. \"type\": \"io.cozy.notifications\", \"verbs\": [\"POST\"] }, + \"account\": { + \"description\": \"Used to send notifications\", + \"type\": \"io.cozy.accounts\", + \"verbs\": [\"POST\"] + }, \"bank.settings\": { \"description\": \"Used to manage your bank settings\", \"type\": \"io.cozy.bank.settings\", $ yarn watch:services # will continuously build `build/notifications.js` $ nodemon --delay 1 -w build/notifications.js --exec \"cozy-konnector-dev -t /tmp/token.json -m manifest.webapp build/notifications.js\" # will launch build/notifications.js (and relaunch it when it changes) with the right COZY_CREDENTIALS, /tmp/token.json is where the token will be stored Emails \u00b6 To see the emails that the stack sends, launch a MailHog instance : docker run -p 1025:1025 -p 8025:8025 mailhog/mailhog The stack will send the emails through the SMTP port of MailHog and you will be able to see the mails in its web interface on http://localhost:8025. Push notifications \u00b6 Similarly, to debug push notifications, you can configure the stack to send push notifications to a local server, and launch a fake push notifications server locally. env PORT=3001 node test/e2e/mock-server.js To configure the stack, edit your cozy.yml config file: + notifications: + android_api_key: 'fake_android_api_key' + fcm_server: 'http://localhost:3001' https://github.com/cozy/cozy-banks/tree/master/src/ducks/notifications/html When creating a notification \u00b6 If you want to test the notifications in a workflow that is very close to the real one, you can import some fixtures to trigger the service execution. For that, you must open the test/fixtures/operations-notifs.json file and edit the following : the _id field of the documents, so they are unique and will create a new document the account field of the io.cozy.bank.operations documents to match an account id that exist on the instance you will import the fixtures to the dates and the labels to be able to see the imported documents easily Then you can use ACH to import the fixtures : ACH import test/fixtures/notifications-service/operations-notifs.json test/fixtures/helpers/index.js --url <instance_url> End to end tests \u00b6 Alert rules \u00b6 Automatic tests \u00b6 Alert rules are tested with automatic tests that Inserts data inside the local cozy-stack Launches the onOperationOrBillCreate service Checks on mailhog the emails received Checks on a mock push server the push notifications received $ export COZY_URL = http://cozy.tools:8080 $ export COZY_CREDENTIALS = $( cozy-stack instances token-app cozy.tools:8080 banks ) $ docker run -p 1025 :1025 -p 8025 :8025 mailhog/mailhog # Deactivate minification with minimize: false in webpack.optimize inside webpack.target.services.js $ env NODE_ENV = services:production yarn webpack --config webpack.config.js --bail --watch $ yarn test:e2e:alerts At the moment, it needs to be launched on the computer of the developer but should be done on the CI in the future. \u26a0\ufe0f You need to have the services built for production for E2E tests to work. \u26a0\ufe0f For push notifications tests to work, you need first to configure the stack so that it uses a fake server that will receive push notifications. Add this to your stack config file : notifications : android_api_key : 'fake_android_api_key' fcm_server : 'http://localhost:3001' Manual insertion test \u00b6 To test on a real Cozy, a script can insert fake transactions on accounts corresponding to alerts, for the onOperationOrBillCreate service to be started. # Insert fake transactions yarn test:e2e:alerts-existing-cozy --url https://mydemocozy.mycozy.cloud insert # Cleanup fake transactions yarn test:e2e:alerts-existing-cozy --url https://mydemocozy.mycozy.cloud cleanup Misc \u00b6 Icons \u00b6 \ud83d\uddbc The PNG icons that are included in the emails are generated manually from the SVG via scripts/icons-to-png.sh and uploaded automatically to files.cozycloud.cc via Jenkins (which follows the file files.cozycloud.cc at the root of the repo). Pouch On Web \u00b6 If you want activate Pouch on web app, you need: - a token - launch your build with FORCE_POUCH cozy-stack instances token-cli cozy.tools:8080 $(cat manifest.webapp | jq -r '[.permissions[] | .type] | join(\" \")') env FORCE_POUCH=true yarn start Launch your web application and in console javascript fill in the token and refresh the page: flag('cozyToken', <your token>) Now you can play with replication: cozyClient.links[0].startReplication() cozyClient.links[0].stopReplication() Important credentials \u00b6 All important credentials are stored in Cozy internal password store .", "title": "Development"}, {"location": "cozy-banks/docs/dev/#development", "text": "", "title": "Development"}, {"location": "cozy-banks/docs/dev/#table-of-contents", "text": "Getting started Fixtures Doctypes Continuous build Release Start a release branch Workflow Publish manually on the Cozy registry Notifications How to develop on templates Under the covers Assets Debug notification triggers Emails Push notifications When creating a notification End to end tests Alert rules Automatic tests Manual insertion test Misc Icons Pouch On Web Important credentials", "title": "Table of Contents"}, {"location": "cozy-banks/docs/dev/#getting-started", "text": "You need to have yarn installed.

Cozy-client Architecture Query definitions Links Store How does it works? Focus on receiveMutationResult : Query definitions \u00b6 To query data, we create a query definition : an object describing what documents to fetch. { doctype: \"io.cozy.todos\", selector: { \"finished\": true } } It is typically created via the helper Q that provides a fluid interface to create a Query Definition . const qdef = Q ( 'io.cozy.todos' ). where ({ finished : true }) Then we need to execute this query, fetch the data, and storing it. await client . query ( qdef ) Links \u00b6 When executed, Query definitions are passed down to Links . Links accept query definitions and can choose either to return a response or to pass the query definition down to the next link. \u2139\ufe0f This is how offline support is implemented: on mobile, a PouchLink (we use PouchDB under the hood) is added as a link to cozy-client, before the default StackLink. The PouchLink can decide: either to pass down the query definition to the next link (if the PouchLink has not been synchronized for example), or to respond to the request by communicating directly with PouchDB. At the moment there are only two links: StackLink : fetches data over HTTP by communicating to the Cozy\u2019s Stack via the StackClient. PouchLink : fetches data from a local PouchDB. Useful to have offline-ready applications. Store \u00b6 When links have responded with data, the data is stored inside the redux store that is internal to cozy-client. This redux store brings observability to cozy-client, and allows for connection of UI components to the data. \u2139\ufe0f You do not need to use Redux in your application to use cozy-client. \u2139\ufe0f You can connect your own store to cozy-client. It is useful for more advanced techniques where you create selectors directly on the data of cozy-client. The redux store is composed of two collections: documents and queries : documents stores the data indexed by doctype then _id queries store information for each query that has been done by cozy-client. ids of the documents that match the query whether the server has more documents that can be fetched (useful for pagination) whether the query is being loaded. { documents : { 'io.cozy.todos' : { 'todo-id-1' : { finished : true , label : \"Add architecture document for cozy-client\" } } }, queries : { finishedTodos : { data : [ 'todo-id-1' ] } } } \u26a0\ufe0f If queries are not named, a name is automatically generated, but this means that the queries collection can grow indefinitely. This is why you are encouraged to name your queries : client.query(qdef, { as: 'finishedTodos'}) . See these naming rules that are followed at Cozy. \u2139\ufe0f See the react integration for more insight about the glue between the redux store and the UI. React example \u00b6 Let\u2019s take a simple React example to demonstrate the connection of UI components to the data: const { data , fetchStatus } = useQuery ( Q ( 'io.cozy.todos' ), { 'as' : 'todoslist' }) if ( fetchStatus === 'loading' ) { return < Spinner /> } if ( fetchStatus === 'loaded' ) { return < TodoLists todos = { data } /> } if ( fetchStatus === 'failed' ) { return < Error /> } This way, a spinner will be displayed during the time the query is actually run. Once the query is done, data for this query is available and can be displayed. On this example, any data change on the io.cozy.todos doctype will be handled by cozy-client and reflected in the data array returned by useQuery . Thus, the app is reactive to any data change, with no hassle for the developer. See the auto query update mechanism for more insights about this mechanism. Queries \u00b6 Here, we describe what happens internally when a query is called from an app. First, it is important to understand that each query is stored in the store, in a queries associative array. Each query has a unique id, a set of metadata, and the list of retrieved document ids. For example: { query1 : { definition : { ... }, fetchStatus : \"loaded\" , lastFetch : 1716989816939 , lastUpdate : 1716989816939 , hasMore : false , count : 2 , bookmark : \"xyz\" , data : [ \"docId1\" , \"docId2\" ] // confusingly named `data`, but only stores ids } } Fetch status \u00b6 An important attribute used for the query lifecycle is the fetchStatus . It can take the following values: - pending : the query is about to be run for the first time. - loading : the query is currently running and might return results. From a UX perspective, it is often used by apps to display a spinner. - loaded : the query had been run and returned results. - failed : the last query execution failed. When a query is called for the first time, it is first initialized in the queries collection in the store, with the pending status. If the query already exists in the store, its status is checked to ensure that it is not already in a loading state. If it the case, a de-duplication mechanism is used to return the stored existing query. See the PR for more details. Then, the query is \u201cloaded\u201d, making its status on loading . Then, the query status is set on loading and the query actually run. When results are retrieved from the database, the status is set to loaded and some additional information are saved in the query store, such as lastFetch and lastUpdate . If any new data is retrieved by the query, all the documents ids retrieved by the query are then stored in the data array. Likewise, the documents collection is updated as well with the full documents content. Auto query update \u00b6 Since there is a link between queries and documents through the ids list in each query object, we need to be able to deal with changes occuring in the documents collection, i.e. when documents are added or deleted. For this, cozy-client has a mechanism called \u201cquery updater\u201d: each time a query is run, all the queries in the store are re-evaluated directly in the store. That means that for each query, we take its definition, convert it into a mango predicate (see here for details), and run it against the store\u2019s document collection. For each query result, we check if there is any change in the known ids list, and update it accordingly. Thanks to this, we ensure that all the queries are always up-to-date, and apps can be effectively rendered thanks to the react integration . Fetch policy and query naming \u00b6 The fetch policy is a useful mechanism to prevent excessive fetching. It is optionnaly defined for each query, to specify a minimum time between 2 actual fetches. It means that after a query is run, if it is called again within this time, it will not be executed. Here is an example to demonstrate how it works: const queryDef = Q ( 'io.cozy.todos' ). where ({ checked : true }) const queryOptions = { as : 'io.cozy.todos/checked/true' , // query unique name, to find it in the store fetchPolicy : CozyClient . fetchPolicies . olderThan ( 10 * 1000 ) // fetch policy, for 10 seconds } // First query let { data : result } = await client . query ( queryDef , queryOptions ) // result is filled // Second query, within the fetch policy time interval setTimeout ( async () => { { data : result } = await client . query ( queryDef , queryOptions ) // result is null }, 5000 ) // Third query, after the fetch policy time interval setTimeout ( async () => { { data : result } = await client . query ( queryDef , queryOptions ) // result is filled }, 10000 ) If the query had been run before the 10 seconds, an early return will happen and nothing will be updated in the store. \ud83d\udca1 In this example, we do not benefit from the React integration like demonstrated in this example with useQuery . When using it, the data is returned even though the fetch policy applies, by taking it directly from the store, to ensure the component is correctly rendered. \ud83d\udca1 In a React context, thanks to the auto-query updater, the data will not be stale if there is a data change in the app: indeed, any change on the documents will trigger the in-memory re-evaluation of the query and a render on the app if something is different. \u2139\ufe0f The as option is used to name the query, which is always a good idea to ensure that it has a unique name. When it\u2019s not specified, a random id is generated, resulting in potential query duplication in the store. Likewise, one must be very careful to prevent queries with the same name, as it would mixup results in the store. Note that you can easily view each query using Devtools to identify duplicates and follow the guidelines for the naming .

See here for an example. When doing so, the app loads the store when it starts and benefit from the instant available cached data. But, the data could have significantly evolved between the last store save and the start, making the documents potentially stale. Hopefully, since the fetch policy is probably expired, queries will be run again, retrieving fresh data. Unfortunately, this might cause an immediate spinning display on the app when it starts, even though there is available data thanks to the persisted store. To solve this, a backgroundFetching option can be set, at the query level, or at the store level (enabled for all queries). When the query is loaded, it simply keeps the query status in loaded state (rather than setting a loading state) and set a new isFetching attribute, stored in the query. Thanks to this, the app can adapt its display to avoid the \u201cspinning effect\u201d, and might inform the user that data is being updated in the background, without refreshing the whole app. See this PR for more insights. Here is a simplified execution sequence with or without background fetching: --- title: Background fetching --- sequenceDiagram participant App as App participant CC as cozy-client participant Store as Store participant Backend as Backend App->>CC: Query documents CC->>Store: Load query alt Without background fetching Store->>Store: update query status Store->>App: Loading query status App->>App: Spinner else With background fetching Store->>Store: no change on query status Store->>App: isFetching status App->>App: Display persisted data end CC->>Backend: Execute query Backend->>CC: New data CC->>Store: Update store CC->>App: New data App->>App: Refresh display Updates \u00b6 Here, we detail what happens when a document is updated, i.e. a mutation happens, typically after a client.save . If the document _id does not exist in the store\u2019s documents collection, i.e. after the a creation, it is simply added. If it already exists, the document content is updated in this collection, after the backend response. Furthermore, just like with the queries, any mutation triggers the auto query updater , that can result in adding or removing document ids. Thanks to it, the app is guaranteed to have the up-to-date documents, returned from the documents collection. \u26a0\ufe0f As already mentioned, when a mutated document already exists in the store throught its _id , it is updated with the new content. However, this update never removes existing fields, it only merges or adds new fields. This is typically useful when two queries retrieve the same document, but not with all the fields. Let us illustrate with this example: const Q1 = { definition : Q ( 'io.cozy.todos' ). getById ( 'my-todo' ), options : { as : 'io.cozy.todos/my-todo' , fetchPolicy : lessThan30s }} const Q2 = { definition : Q ( 'io.cozy.todos' ). getById ( 'my-todo' ). select ([ 'label' ]), options : { as : 'io.cozy.todos/my-todo/withLabel' }} await client . query ( Q1 ) // returns { _id: 'my-todo', _type: 'io.cozy.todos', label: 'TODOTODO' }, from the database await client . query ( Q2 ) // returns { label: 'TODOTODO' }, from the database await client . query ( Q1 ) // returns { _id: 'my-todo', _type: 'io.cozy.todos', label: 'TODOTODO' }, from the store Q1 retrieves the full content of \u2018my-todo\u2019 while Q2 only retrieves its label. When Q2 is run, \u2018my-todo\u2019 already exists in the store, as Q1 was previsouly run. However, the fields retrieved by Q1 for \u2018my-todos\u2019 but absent from Q2 are not lost. This way, when Q1 is run again, the results fetched from the store (thanks to the fetch policy) will include all the fields. \u26a0\ufe0f The problem is when some fields are removed from a document: the store will not reflect this change and result in stale data. To avoid this side-effect, one could set an attribute to undefined instead of removing it, as a workaround. In-memory queries evaluation \u00b6 Each time a change occurs in the store\u2019s documents collection, either through a query or an update, all the stored queries are dynamically re-evaluated. As we do not want to request the actual database each time, we do the evaluation directly from the store, in memory. To achieve this, we need to evaluate queries the same way it would have been done on the database side. Our query system relies on mango, a mongo-like query system supported by CouchDB, the Cozy database. We rely on sift.js for the in-memory query evaluation. This library is able to take as input a mongo query definition and transform it into a javascript predicate. Then, all the queries are evaluated on the stores\u2019s documents , and efficiently updated accordingly to the results. \ud83d\udca1 If you want to know more about our query system and syntax, please check this documentation . \u26a0\ufe0f Please note that there is not a perfect matching between mango operators and sift, see this issue for instance. \u2139\ufe0f You can also directly run a query on the store\u2019s documents , and never actually use the database.

When results are retrieved from the database, the status is set to loaded and some additional information are saved in the query store, such as lastFetch and lastUpdate .

For this, cozy-client has a mechanism called \u201cquery updater\u201d: each time a query is run, all the queries in the store are re-evaluated directly in the store. That means that for each query, we take its definition, convert it into a mango predicate (see here for details), and run it against the store\u2019s document collection. For each query result, we check if there is any change in the known ids list, and update it accordingly. Thanks to this, we ensure that all the queries are always up-to-date, and apps can be effectively rendered thanks to the react integration .", "title": "Auto query update"}, {"location": "cozy-client/architecture/#fetch-policy-and-query-naming", "text": "The fetch policy is a useful mechanism to prevent excessive fetching. It is optionnaly defined for each query, to specify a minimum time between 2 actual fetches. It means that after a query is run, if it is called again within this time, it will not be executed. Here is an example to demonstrate how it works: const queryDef = Q ( 'io.cozy.todos' ). where ({ checked : true }) const queryOptions = { as : 'io.cozy.todos/checked/true' , // query unique name, to find it in the store fetchPolicy : CozyClient . fetchPolicies . olderThan ( 10 * 1000 ) // fetch policy, for 10 seconds } // First query let { data : result } = await client . query ( queryDef , queryOptions ) // result is filled // Second query, within the fetch policy time interval setTimeout ( async () => { { data : result } = await client . query ( queryDef , queryOptions ) // result is null }, 5000 ) // Third query, after the fetch policy time interval setTimeout ( async () => { { data : result } = await client . query ( queryDef , queryOptions ) // result is filled }, 10000 ) If the query had been run before the 10 seconds, an early return will happen and nothing will be updated in the store. \ud83d\udca1 In this example, we do not benefit from the React integration like demonstrated in this example with useQuery . When using it, the data is returned even though the fetch policy applies, by taking it directly from the store, to ensure the component is correctly rendered. \ud83d\udca1 In a React context, thanks to the auto-query updater, the data will not be stale if there is a data change in the app: indeed, any change on the documents will trigger the in-memory re-evaluation of the query and a render on the app if something is different. \u2139\ufe0f The as option is used to name the query, which is always a good idea to ensure that it has a unique name. When it\u2019s not specified, a random id is generated, resulting in potential query duplication in the store. Likewise, one must be very careful to prevent queries with the same name, as it would mixup results in the store.

See here for an example. When doing so, the app loads the store when it starts and benefit from the instant available cached data. But, the data could have significantly evolved between the last store save and the start, making the documents potentially stale. Hopefully, since the fetch policy is probably expired, queries will be run again, retrieving fresh data. Unfortunately, this might cause an immediate spinning display on the app when it starts, even though there is available data thanks to the persisted store. To solve this, a backgroundFetching option can be set, at the query level, or at the store level (enabled for all queries). When the query is loaded, it simply keeps the query status in loaded state (rather than setting a loading state) and set a new isFetching attribute, stored in the query. Thanks to this, the app can adapt its display to avoid the \u201cspinning effect\u201d, and might inform the user that data is being updated in the background, without refreshing the whole app. See this PR for more insights.

If the document _id does not exist in the store\u2019s documents collection, i.e. after the a creation, it is simply added. If it already exists, the document content is updated in this collection, after the backend response. Furthermore, just like with the queries, any mutation triggers the auto query updater , that can result in adding or removing document ids. Thanks to it, the app is guaranteed to have the up-to-date documents, returned from the documents collection. \u26a0\ufe0f As already mentioned, when a mutated document already exists in the store throught its _id , it is updated with the new content. However, this update never removes existing fields, it only merges or adds new fields. This is typically useful when two queries retrieve the same document, but not with all the fields. Let us illustrate with this example: const Q1 = { definition : Q ( 'io.cozy.todos' ). getById ( 'my-todo' ), options : { as : 'io.cozy.todos/my-todo' , fetchPolicy : lessThan30s }} const Q2 = { definition : Q ( 'io.cozy.todos' ). getById ( 'my-todo' ). select ([ 'label' ]), options : { as : 'io.cozy.todos/my-todo/withLabel' }} await client . query ( Q1 ) // returns { _id: 'my-todo', _type: 'io.cozy.todos', label: 'TODOTODO' }, from the database await client . query ( Q2 ) // returns { label: 'TODOTODO' }, from the database await client . query ( Q1 ) // returns { _id: 'my-todo', _type: 'io.cozy.todos', label: 'TODOTODO' }, from the store Q1 retrieves the full content of \u2018my-todo\u2019 while Q2 only retrieves its label. When Q2 is run, \u2018my-todo\u2019 already exists in the store, as Q1 was previsouly run. However, the fields retrieved by Q1 for \u2018my-todos\u2019 but absent from Q2 are not lost. This way, when Q1 is run again, the results fetched from the store (thanks to the fetch policy) will include all the fields. \u26a0\ufe0f The problem is when some fields are removed from a document: the store will not reflect this change and result in stale data.

This is not possible on mobile as there is no server to serve the page. CozyClient supports connecting to a Cozy via OAtuh. To get started, configure the OAuth settings when creating the client: import CozyClient from 'cozy-client' const client = new CozyClient ({ uri : 'http://cozy.tools:8080' , scope : [ 'io.cozy.mydoctype' ], oauth : { clientName : 'MyClient' , softwareID : 'MyAppId' , redirectURI : 'http://localhost' } }) scope is an array of permissions you require for your client oauth is a list of fields that identify your client for the user and the server. The complete list of field can be found here , although they should be camel-cased instead of snake-cased. Starting the OAuth flow \ud83c\udfc4\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \u00b6 Before you can start making requests to the server, you will need to get a token. cozy-client will provide a URL to a page where the user is shown what data you want to access, and asking for his or her permission. After the user accepts these permissions, he or she is redirected to the oauth.redirectURI that you declared earlier. You will then have to give this redirected URL back to cozy-client as it contains a code, that will be exchanged for the token. To get started, you call client.startOAuthFlow like this: import CozyClient from 'cozy-client' const client = new CozyClient ({ uri : 'http://cozy.tools:8080' , scope : [ 'io.cozy.mydoctype' ], oauth : { clientName : 'MyClient' , softwareID : 'MyAppId' , redirectURI : 'http://localhost' } }) client . startOAuthFlow ( openURL ) The openURL parameter is a callback.

After the promise is resolved, cozy-client finishes the OAuth flow and you can start using it. How to restore a previous token ? \u00b6 Nobody likes to enter passwords, and you don\u2019t want to make your user go through this whole process every time your app starts. In order to restore the client from a previous version, you need to give it a token and some extra information about itself. Both of these are returned by the openURL function, so you can store them wherever you see fit \u2014 in this example we\u2019ll use the localStorage API. import CozyClient from 'cozy-client' const client = new CozyClient ({ uri : 'http://cozy.tools:8080' , scope : [ 'io.cozy.mydoctype' ], oauth : { clientName : 'MyClient' , softwareID : 'MyAppId' , redirectURI : 'http://localhost' } }) const { token , infos } = client . startOAuthFlow ( openURL ) localStorage . setItem ( 'token' , token ) localStorage . setItem ( 'infos' , JSON . stringify ( infos )) Next time your app starts, you can pass these informations to the constructor.

You can just use cozyClient.logout() . Support offline for some doctypes with cozy-pouch-link \u00b6 If you are already using cozy-client and the StackLink , you may want to go further and store some documents locally so you can retrieve them even while being offline. Currently, you have a code like this one : import CozyClient , { StackLink } from 'cozy-client' const stackLink = new StackLink () const client = new CozyClient ({ // ... links : [ stackLink ] }) To manage the offline aspect, we provide the cozy-pouch-link .

All doctypes that are not managed by the PouchLink will be passed to the next link in the chain (in the previous example, the StackLink ). Additionally, it is possible to replicate some doctypes only in a specific direction: const pouchLink = new PouchLink ({ doctypes : [ 'io.cozy.todos' , 'io.cozy.files' , 'io.cozy.localtype' ], doctypesReplicationOptions : { 'io.cozy.todos' : { strategy : 'sync' // default, replicate both ways }, 'io.cozy.files' : { strategy : 'fromRemote' // replicate changes from the remote locally, but don't push any changes }, 'io.cozy.localtype' : { strategy : 'toRemote' // push changes to remote, but don't replicate changes from it } } initialSync : true }) If you choose the fromRemote strategy, the cozy-client mutation will not be executed on the PouchLink but rather on the StackLink.

This document aims to describe how to use this API. Nomenclature \u00b6 PerformanceAPI : The API provided by CozyClient for measuring timings in the code base Performance devtools : Browsers devtools pane dedicated to performance (i.e. Chrome devtools and Firefox profiled ) Mark : A temporal event Measure : A timing measurement between two temporal events The API \u00b6 The PerformanceAPI can be used to measure code execution timings. It is meant to wrap platform specific APIs like web\u2019s Performance API , or React Native\u2019s dedicated plugin . For now the CozyClient\u2019s API only exposes a limited subset of methods, which are mark() and measure() with slightly different interfaces than their original implementation in order to fit Cozy\u2019s needs without the original APIs complexity (their interface will be described in following sections). Those methods can be used to measure temporal events and their duration. They do not output anything in the console but they maintain a list of measurements that can be then visualized in dedicated tools like browsers\u2019 Performance devtools. API initialization \u00b6 Because the measurement framework may differ based on the platform (i.e. web, mobile, nodejs), the PerformanceAPI has to be injected through CozyClient and CozyLinks constructor before being used. Because CozyClient\u2019s main usage is in web apps, a webPerformanceAPI implementation is already provided by CozyClient. On other platforms, the implementation should be provided by the consuming app. Example of CozyClient initialization with web compatible version of the PerformanceAPI import CozyClient , { webPerformanceAPI } from 'cozy-client' const client = new CozyClient ({ uri , schema , token , performancesApi : webPerformanceAPI }) By default, CozyClient will not do any measurement if no PerformanceAPI is injected. Mark method \u00b6 The first API method is mark(markName) . This method\u2019s goal is to add a temporal mark that can be used for future measurements. For example it can be used to mark when a method starts or when any particular event happens (i.e. hiding splashscreen in mobile app). Exemple of marking the call of CozyClient\u2019s query() method async query ( queryDefinition , { update , executeFromStore , ... options } = {}) { const markName = client . mark ( `client.query( ${ queryDefinition . doctype } )` ) // ... method implementation } The method takes a markName argument. This name can be any string. The common usage is to describe the happening event. Because we expect to measure some methods that are called multiple times in parallel, the mark(markName) method will internally prefix the markName with some unique ID. This would ensure each mark is uniquely identified. async query ( queryDefinition , { update , executeFromStore , ... options } = {}) { const markName = client . mark ( `Some mark name` ) console . log ( markName ) // \"42 Some mark name\" } Measure method \u00b6 The previously described mark(markName) method can be used to place some temporal marks in the code. The measure(options) method can be used to measure the elapsed time since a specified temporal mark. Example of measuring the elapsed time between the call of CozyClient\u2019s query() method and its ending async query ( queryDefinition , { update , executeFromStore , ... options } = {}) { const markName = client . mark ( `client.query( ${ queryDefinition . doctype } )` ) // ... method implementation this . performanceApi . measure ({ markName }) } This methods takes an options argument that can contains: - markName : the reference mark used as starting point for the measurement - measureName (optional): the name of the measure that will be displayed by visualizing tools - if not provided, the markName will be used instead. This parameter is useful when doing multiple different measures that use the same mark as starting point - color (optional): can be used to specify the color of the event when displayed in visualizing tools - only a specific set of semantic colors can be used (i.e. primary , secondary , error etc.). Available colors are described in the JSDoc - category (optional): can be used to split measurements in multiple categories when displayed in visualizing tools - this can be any string. Visualizing tools tends create as many category as provided (hence their are some exceptions like ReactNative\u2019s flipper plugin) Example of measuring the elapsed time between the call of CozyClient\u2019s query() method and its ending or its failing block async query ( queryDefinition , { update , executeFromStore , ... options } = {}) { const markName = client . mark ( `client.query( ${ queryDefinition . doctype } )` ) try { // ... method implementation this . performanceApi . measure ({ markName : markQuery , measureName : ` ${ markName } success` , category : 'CozyClient queries' }) } catch ( error ) { this . performanceApi . measure ({ markName : markQuery , measureName : ` ${ markName } error` , category : 'CozyClient queries' , color : 'error' }) } } Adding measurements \u00b6 On initial implementation, we chose to measure some parts of the code that we estimated useful and with potential high impact on performances (i.e. queries, store management, pouch management etc.). We expect to need more measurements in the future but we need to care to keep the balance beetween having useful measurements and to not visualy overload the measurement graphs. The API is meant to be simple to use so measurements can be quickly temporarily added in development environments. In the scenario where a measurement seems to be useful enough to be permanently added to our code base, please consider discussing this choice with the development team. Web usage \u00b6 On web environment, it is possible to inject the already provided webPerformanceAPI implementation of the API. Example of CozyClient initialization with web compatible version of the PerformanceAPI import CozyClient , { webPerformanceAPI } from 'cozy-client' const client = new CozyClient ({ uri , schema , token , performancesApi : webPerformanceAPI }) Then CozyClient will use this implementation to do its internal measurements. The consuming app can also add its own measurements by either: - Calling client.performanceAPI.mark() and client.performanceAPI.measure() method - Directly calling the web native API performance.mark() and performance.measure() - However, please keep in mind that if both APIs will produce the same output, their interface is slightly different. So for code homogeneity purpose, please prefer using the CozyClient\u2019s API When the PerformanceAPI is used, then the result can be visualized in the browser\u2019s Performance develools. Other platforms \u00b6 No implementation is provided by CozyClient for other platforms. So each consuming app needs to provide their own implementation of the API. The API interface is described in the JSDoc. Example of custom implementations: - Flagship App: feat: Add performance measurements Production environment \u00b6 By default, if no API is injected, then CozyClient will use the defaultPerformanceAPI implementation that does nothing.

Once connected, your components will receive the requesting data and a fetch status in their props. The data will automatically be refreshed upon modification. 1. Setup 1.a Initialize a CozyClient provider 1.b Use your own Redux store 2. Usage 2.a Requesting data with useQuery 2.b Requesting data with the queryConnect HOC 2.c Using a fetch policy to decrease network requests 2.d Keeping data up to date in real time 3. Mutating data 3.a Mutating data with useMutation 3.b Mutating data with Query 4. Testing 1. Setup \u00b6 The following procedure requires you to already know how to initialize a CozyClient instance and create a query to fetch documents. \u26a0\ufe0f The fromDOM instantiation method assumes the page you use is served by the Cozy Stack, and that there is a DOM node with the stack info. See how the application works for more information. <div role='application' data-cozy=' {{ .CozyData }} ' /> 1.a Initialize a CozyClient provider \u00b6 Import CozyClient and CozyProvider import CozyClient , { CozyProvider } from 'cozy-client' Initialize a CozyClient instance (see the CozyClient() documentation for additional parameters, for example to provide a schema) const client = CozyClient . fromDOM () Then wrap you React application inside a CozyProvider component with your newly instance of CozyClient in its props as client . function MyCozyApp ( props ) { return < CozyProvider client = { client }> < MyApp { ...props } /> </ CozyProvider > } ReactDOM . render (< MyCozyApp />, document . getElementById ( 'main' ) ) The CozyClient will be available for consumption to all components inside your wrapped application. 1.b Use your own Redux store \u00b6 cozy-client uses redux internally to centralize the statuses of the various fetches and replications triggered by the library, and to store locally the data in a normalized way. If you already have a redux store in your app, you can configure cozy-client to use this existing store: import CozyClient , { CozyProvider } from 'cozy-client' import { combineReducers , createStore , applyMiddleware } from 'redux' const client = CozyClient . fromDOM ({ store : false // Important, otherwise a default store is created }) const store = createStore ( combineReducers ({ ... myReducers , cozy : client . reducer () }), applyMiddleware ( myMiddleware ) ) function MyCozyApp ( props ) { return < CozyProvider client = { client } store = { store }> < MyApp { ...props } /> </ CozyProvider > } ReactDOM . render (< MyCozyApp />, document . getElementById ( 'main' ) ) 2. Usage \u00b6 2.a Requesting data with useQuery \u00b6 useQuery is the most straightforward to fetch data from the Cozy. Query results are cached and can be reused across components, you just have to name the query results (\u201cchecked-todos\u201d) below. import CozyClient , { useQuery , isQueryLoading , Q } from 'cozy-client' const client = CozyClient . fromDOM () client . ensureStore () const todos = 'io.cozy.todos' const checked = { checked : false } // Use the Q helper to build queries const queryDefinition = Q ( todos ). where ( checked ) function TodoList ( props ) { const queryResult = useQuery ( queryDefinition , { as : 'checked-todos' , fetchPolicy : CozyClient . fetchPolicies . olderThan ( 30 * 1000 ) }) return <> { queryResult => isQueryLoading ( queryResult ) ? < h1 > Loading ...</ h1 > : < ul >{ queryResult . data . map ( todo => < li >{ todo . label }</ li >)}</ ul > } < /> } function App () { return < CozyProvider client = { client }> < TodoList /> </ CozyProvider > } useQuery also supports a \u201cdisabled\u201d parameter: if set to false the query won\u2019t be executed. This is useful when you have dependent queries that rely on the results of another query to have been fetched. 2.b Requesting data with <Query /> \u00b6 If you cannot use a hook, you can use the Query render-prop component. Basic example of usage: import { Query , isQueryLoading , Q } from 'cozy-client' import React from 'react' const todos = 'io.cozy.todos' const checked = { checked : false } // Use the Q helper to build queries const queryDefinition = Q ( todos ). where ( checked ) const TodoList = () => ( < Query query = { queryDefinition }> { queryResult => isQueryLoading ( queryResult ) ? < h1 > Loading ...</ h1 > : < ul >{ queryResult . data . map ( todo => < li >{ todo . label }</ li >)}</ ul > } </ Query > ) When we use Query to \u201cwrap\u201d a component, three things happen: - The query passed as a prop will be executed when Query mounts, resulting in the loading of data from the local Pouchdb (if any) or from the server; in the future it may load the data directly from the client-side store; - Query subscribes to the store, so that it is updated if the data changes; - Query passes the result of the query as props to the children function. The following props will be given to your wrapped component: - data : an array of documents - fetchStatus : the status of the fetch ( pending , loading , loaded or error ) - lastFetch : when the last fetch occurred - hasMore : the fetches being paginated, this property indicates if there are more documents to load You can also pass a function instead of a direct query definition. Your function will be given the props of the component and should return the requested query definition: import { Query , Q } from 'cozy-client' import React from 'react' const queryDefinition = function ( props ) { const todos = 'io.cozy.todos' const where = { checked : props . checked } return Q ( todos ). where ( where ) } const TodoList = ({ props }) => ( < Query query = { queryDefinition } checked = { props . checked }> {({ data , fetchStatus }) => ( fetchStatus !== 'loaded' ? < h1 > Loading ...</ h1 > : < ul >{ data . map ( todo => < li >{ todo . label }</ li >)}</ ul > ) } </ Query > ) // use <TodoList checked={false}/> Note: Your query definition will be bound when the <Query/> component mounts. Future changes in props will not modify the query. 2.c Requesting data with the queryConnect HOC \u00b6 At your preference, you can use a higher-order component. queryConnect will take the name of the props field where it should send the result of the query and the actual query: import { queryConnect , Q } from 'cozy-client' function TodoList ( props ) { const { data , fetchStatus } = props . result if ( fetchStatus !== 'loaded' ) { return < h1 > Loading ...</ h1 > } else { return < ul >{ data . map ( todo => < li >{ todo . label }</ li >)}</ ul > } } const ConnectedTodoList = queryConnect ({ result : { query : Q ( 'io.cozy.todos' ). where ({ checked : false }) } })( TodoList ) queryConnect will use <Query /> internally, so you will inherit the same behaviour. With the same syntax, you may register multiple queries to run: import { queryConnect , Q } from 'cozy-client' function TodoList ( props ) { const { data , fetchStatus } = props . checked if ( fetchStatus !== 'loaded' ) { return < h1 > Loading ...</ h1 > } else { return < ul >{ data . map ( todo => < li >{ todo . label }</ li >)}</ ul > } } const todos = 'io.cozy.todos' const checked = { query : Q ( todos ). where ({ checked : false }) } const archived = { query : Q ( todos ). where ({ archive : false }) } const queries = { checked , archived } const ConnectedTodoList = queryConnect ( queries )( TodoList ) 2.d Using a fetch policy to decrease network requests \u00b6 When multiple components share the same data, you might want to share the data between the two components. In this case, you do not want to execute 2 network requests for the same data, the two components should share the same data and only 1 network request should be executed. There are two solutions: 1) Lift the data fetching up the React tree: make a parent of the two components be the responsible for the data. 2) Using fetch policies to prevent re-fetching of the data 1 can be a good solution but sometimes the components needing the data are too far down the tree and/or too decoupled; it might not make sense to lift the data fetching up only to have to drill the data down the tree again. Using useQuery , Query and queryConnect , you can declare a fetch policy . It tells cozy-client if it should execute the query at componentDidMount time. It enables N components to be connected to the same query without triggering N requests. A fetch policy is a function receiving the state of the current query and returning true if it should be fetched and false otherwise. It is important to name the query with as when using fetch policies otherwise query data cannot be shared across components. import { Q } from 'cozy-client' const queryDefinition = () => Q ( 'io.cozy.todos' ) const MyComponent = () => { // io.cozy.todos will not be refetched if there are already io.cozy.todos // in the store and the data is fresh (updated less than 30s ago). const fetchPolicy = CozyClient . olderThan ( 30 * 1000 ) const as = 'my-query' // With Query and a render prop return (< Query as = { as } query = { queryDefinition } fetchPolicy = { fetchPolicy }>{ ({ data : todos }) => {< TodoList todos = { todos } />} }</ Query >) } // With queryConnect queryConnect ({ todos : { as , query , fetchPolicy } })( TodoList ) See CozyClient::fetchPolicies for the API documentation. 2.e Keeping data up to date in real time \u00b6 Sometimes the data you are displaying will be changed from other places than your app. Maybe the data is shared and someone else has updated it, or maybe it simply changes over time. You can however keep your UI always up to date without constantly re-running your queries, by subscribing to changes in real time. This is done with the RealTimeQueries component: import { RealTimeQueries } from 'cozy-client' function MyParentComponent ( props ) { return ( <> < ConnectedTodoList /> < RealTimeQueries doctype = \"io.cozy.todos\" /> < /> ) } You subscribe to changes for an entire doctype using RealTimeQueries , and as long as that component is rendered all documents from the given doctype in your queries will automatically stay up to date. 3. Mutating data \u00b6 The simplest way is to use the hook useClient to get the CozyClient instance you gave to the <CozyProvider /> upper. import { useClient } from 'cozy-client' function TodoList ( props ) { const client = useClient () const createNewTodo = e => client . create ( 'io.cozy.todos' , { label : e . target . elements [ 'new-todo' ], checked : false } ) return ( <> < ul > { /* todo items */ } </ ul > < form onSubmit = { createNewTodo }> < label htmlFor = \"new-todo\" > Todo </ label > < input id = \"new-todo\" name = \"new-todo\" /> < button type = \"submit\" > Add todo </ button > </ form > < /> ) } 3.a Mutating data with useMutation \u00b6 We also provides a hook to manage client.save mutation state called useMutation . import { useMutation } from 'cozy-client' function TodoLabelInlineEdit ({ todo }) { const [ label , setLabel ] = useState ( todo . label ) const { mutate , mutationStatus } = useMutation () const handleChange = event => { setLabel ( event . target . value ) } const handleBlur = () => { mutate ({ ... todo , label }) } return ( < div style = {{ display : 'flex' }}> < input type = \"text\" aria - label = \"Label\" style = {{ marginRight : '1rem' }} value = { label } onChange = { handleChange } onBlur = { handleBlur } /> { mutationStatus === 'loaded' ? '\u2713' : null } { mutationStatus === 'failed' ? '\u2717' : null } </ div > ) } 3.b Mutating data with Query \u00b6 <Query /> also takes a mutations optional props. It should have a function that will receive the CozyClient instance, the query requested and the rest of props given to the component, and should return a keyed object which will be added to the props of your wrapped component. import { Query } from 'cozy-client' const todos = 'io.cozy.todos' const checked = { checked : false } const queryDefinition = Q ( todos ). where ( checked ) const mutations = client => ({ createDocument : client . create . bind ( client ) }) function TodoList () { return < Query query = { queryDefinition } mutations = { mutations }> { ({ data , fetchStatus }) => fetchStatus !== 'loaded' ? < h1 > Loading ...</ h1 > : < ul >{ data . map ( todo => < li >{ todo . label }</ li >)}</ ul > } </ Query > } 4. Testing \u00b6 When testing, it is useful to prefill the client with data and mock the network. You can use createMockClient for this. Say we want to test the following component: import React from 'react' import { useQuery , Q } from 'cozy-client' function TodoList () { const { data , fetchStatus , lastError } = useQuery ( Q ( 'io.cozy.todos' ), { as : 'todos' }) if ( fetchStatus === 'failed' ) { return < h1 > An error occurred : { lastError . message }</ h1 > } else if ( fetchStatus !== 'loaded' ) { return < h1 > Loading ...</ h1 > } else { return ( <> < h1 id = \"todos-heading\" > Todos </ h1 > < ul aria - labelledby = \"todos-heading\" > { data . map ( todo => ( < li key = { todo . id }>{ todo . label }</ li > ))} </ ul > < /> ) } } export default TodoList We want to make sure the component renders correctly. In our test, we can create a mocked client with predefined data for the todos query, and test it with testing-library : import React from 'react' import { createMockClient , CozyProvider } from 'cozy-client' import { render , screen , within } from '@testing-library/react' import TodoList from './TodoList' describe ( 'TodoList' , () => { const setup = client => { return render ( < CozyProvider client = { client }> < TodoList /> </ CozyProvider > ) } it ( 'should show the todos' , () => { const mockClient = createMockClient ({ queries : { todos : { doctype : 'io.cozy.todos' , data : [ { id : 'todo1' , name : 'Write tests' , done : true }, { id : 'todo2' , name : 'Write code' , done : true }, { id : 'todo3' , name : 'Take breaks' , done : true }, { id : 'todo4' , name : 'Write documentation' , done : false } ] } } }) setup ( mockClient ) const list = screen . getByRole ( 'list' , { name : /todos/i }) const { getAllByRole } = within ( list ) const items = getAllByRole ( 'listitem' ) expect ( items . length ). toBe ( 4 ) }) it ( 'should display the error message' , () => { const mockClient = createMockClient ({ queries : { todos : { doctype : 'io.cozy.todos' , queryError : new Error ( 'Network error' ) } } }) setup ( mockClient ) expect ( screen . getByText ( /network error/i )). toBeDefined () }) })", "title": "React integration"}, {"location": "cozy-client/react-integration/#what-is-the-cozy-client-react-integration", "text": "In addition to the Javascript client, Cozy-Client provides a way to connect directly the data from your Cozy instance to your React components.

Testing"}, {"location": "cozy-client/relationships/", "text": "What are relations in Cozy-Client? \u00b6 CouchDB is a document store. It does not materialize relations between documents. We do, however, have a standardized way of describing relations between cozy documents. This allows Cozy-Client to give us some automation. In CouchDB \u00b6 Relations between documents are materialized under a relationships object at the root of the document. Relations are referenced by their names, e.g. authors . Each relation is an object with a data property, containing either one reference , or an array of references . A reference is an object containing at least: * _type : the name of the referenced doctype, e.g. io.cozy.contacts * _id : the id of the referenced document. For instance, a book -> authors relationship might be represented like this: { \"_id\" : \"mobydick\" , \"relationships\" : { \"authors\" : { \"data\" : [{ \"_id\" : \"hermanmelville\" , \"_type\" : \"io.cozy.contacts\" }] } } } Please see the cozy-doctypes documentation for more insights about the syntax. In the Cozy-Client schema \u00b6 Cozy-client knows how to handle these relations thanks to the schema you provide at initialization: const schema = { books : { doctype : 'io.cozy.books' , attributes : {}, relationships : { authors : { doctype : 'io.cozy.contacts' , type : 'has-many' } } } } const client = new CozyClient ({ uri : 'http://cozy.tools:8080' , token : '...' , schema }) We explain below what are the different types of relations. Relation types \u00b6 Cozy-Client predefines two basic relation types that must be specified in the schema: 'has-one' : the relation has a unique reference. 'has-many' : the relation can have several references. Files relations \u00b6 The files implements a special type of relation: 'io.cozy.files:has-many' . This relation name is referenced_by , which is an array of references, just like the 'has-many' relation. The stack implements routes to handle this kind of relation on the /files endpoint. See the stack documentation . Note specific view index are defined on referenced_by relationships, allowing fast queries on it. Customize relations \u00b6 You are free to create your own relation type if you need a special behaviour. For instance, Banks doctypes implements HasManyBills or HasManyReimbursements . Old relation types \u00b6 Note there are two others basic relations, that are here for backward compatibility: 'has-one-in-place' 'has-many-in-place' \u26a0\ufe0f For new doctypes, you should not use those relations, prefer 'has-one' or 'has-many' . With these relations, instead of using the relationships attribute, you reference directly the ids of linked documents at the root of your data: const schema = { books : { doctype : 'io.cozy.books' , attributes : {}, relationships : { authors : { doctype : 'io.cozy.contacts' , type : 'has-many-in-place' } } } } const book = { \"_id\" : \"mobydick\" , \"authors\" : [ \"hermanmelville\" ] } Metadata \u00b6 It is possible to assign metadatas to relationships. You need to modify the content of the document relationships somehow and save the modified document. const doc = { _id : \"mobydick\" , relationships : { authors : { data : [{ _id : \"hermanmelville\" , _type : \"io.cozy.contacts\" }] } } } doc . relationships . authors . data [ 0 ]. metadata = { addressId : \"123\" } await client . save ( doc ) Usage \u00b6 Include relations in your query \u00b6 Relations are not loaded eagerly by default. If you want your query to load your relations for you, you will have to name them in an include() request. const query = Q ( 'io.cozy.books' ) . include ([ 'authors' ]) . limitBy ( 20 ) You will then find your relations under the data attribute: const response = await client . query ( query ) const docs = response . data const firstDoc = docs [ 0 ] const firstAuthors = firstDoc . authors . data Add a relation to an existing document \u00b6 When the relationship is a has-many type, you can call the add(docs) to create the relationship: const otherAuthors = [{ _id : 'Rivest' }, { _id : 'Shamir' }] const response = await client . query ( query ) const docs = response . data const firstDoc = docs [ 0 ] firstDoc . authors . add ( otherAuthors ) add also accepts single document: firstDoc . authors . add ({ _id : 'Adleman' }) Likewise, when the relationship is a has-one , use add(doc) : const printer = { _id : 'abc123' , _type : 'io.cozy.company' , name : 'Harper & Brothers' } const response = await client . query ( query ) const docs = response . data const firstDoc = docs [ 0 ] firstDoc . printingCompany . add ( printer ) Remove a relation to an existing document \u00b6 For has-many relationships, use the remove(docs) method: const wrongAuthors = [{ _id : 'James Wrong' }, { _id : 'Henry Mistake' }] const response = await client . query ( query ) const docs = response . data const firstDoc = docs [ 0 ] firstDoc . authors . remove ( wrongAuthors ) Just like add , remove accepts a single document. For has-one relationships, just use remove() , with no argument: const response = await client . query ( query ) const docs = response . data const firstDoc = docs [ 0 ] firstDoc . printingCompany . remove () Create a new file with existing relations \u00b6 Simply pass the reference to your file as a third parameter to create() : const photo = { _id : \"sunset.jpg\" } const reference = { _id : \"1324\" , _type : \"io.cozy.photos.albums\" } const albumReference = { albums : [ albumReference ] } await client . create ( 'io.cozy.files' , photo , albumReference )", "title": "Using relationships"}, {"location": "cozy-client/relationships/#what-are-relations-in-cozy-client", "text": "CouchDB is a document store.

Deleted and trashed documents can be filtered on demand and files' paths can be requested as well. Since deleted and trashed documents are skipped by cozy-stack rather than CouchDB, when either option is set to true, the response can contain less documents than the defined limit. Thus one should rely solely on the pending result attribute to determine if more documents can be fetched or not. You should use fetchChangesRaw to call CouchDB's _changes API.

But lots of our early-adopters were GNU/Linux users. And we are GNU/Linux users ourselves too. So we had to bring back GNU/Linux support at some point. There are many GNU/Linux distributions out there, and even in the Cozy team people use many of them. Providing quality packages for everybody can be quite time consuming. So we decided to start with a solution that was easy for us to set up: AppImage . Easy since it\u2019s included in electron-builder, the tool we already use to generate the Windows and macOS apps. User experience definitely won\u2019t be the best (it will look a lot like good old proprietary driver install scripts). But it should at least work for most people and give us a way to quickly start getting feedback regarding other possible issues. And the app will auto-update the same way as the Windows or macOS ones. We\u2019ll provide packages for major distros as soon as possible (unofficial nightly builds for Debian and Ubuntu are already being tested internally). Supported distributions \u00b6 A few things to know: - The current AppImage needs a relatively recent versions of : - GLIBC >= 2.32 - GLIBCXX >= 3.4.21 - The application should work with most desktop manager but is actively tested on Gnome 3 - The systray icon might only show up on some desktop managers if you use a third-party software like the TopIcons-Plus Gnome extension or libappindicator; it is up to you to install the third-party software if needed We only support the latest version of each distribution although the app could work on older versions. The table below can be outdated. Distribution supported comment Fedora 38 yes Debian 12 (Bookworm) yes Ubuntu 23.04 (Lunar Lobster) yes Linux Mint 21.2 (Victoria) yes Archlinux yes if up-to-date Add your distribution (see below) \u2026 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Fedora 37 no should work Debian 11 (Bullseye) no should work Ubuntu 22.10 (Kinetic Kudu) no should work Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish) no should work after installing FUSE ( sudo apt install libfuse2 ) Linux Mint 21.1 (Vera) no should work Mageia 8 no should work openSUSE Leap 15.4 no should work Before requesting for your distribution to be added to the list, please: Include the exact name and version of your distribution Retrieve your GLIBC and GLIBCXX versions by running the following commands in a terminal: strings $(locate -b '\\libstdc++.so.6') | grep '^GLIBCXX_[0-9.]*$' | sort -V | tail -n 1 strings $(locate -b '\\libstdc++.so.6') | grep '^GLIBC_[0-9.]*$' | sort -V | tail -n 1 (and include the output in your request) Install the app, run it and make sure it actually works If your distribution is not supported follow the manual build guide and jump to the second part of the Install section. Install \u00b6 Note for Archlinux Users You can install cozy-desktop from the [community] repo. Download the *.AppImage file for your architecture from the latest release . You probably don\u2019t want to keep the app in your /Downloads folder and run it from there. You can for example create a macOS-like Applications folder and move it there. Advanced users may prefer to move it to some special folder ( ~/.local/bin/ , ~/bin/ , /opt/ \u2026). Integration with the system \u00b6 By default, the application will only be launchable by double-clicking the AppImage file you downloaded. If you want it to be available in your applications menu, you can install the appimaged daemon, available from its github repository \u2018s releases or via your distribution package manager. If you install it from the repository, you might need to run the following commands in a terminal to make sure it is run when starting your user session: $ systemctl --user add-wants default.target appimaged $ systemctl --user start appimaged # restart your user session now After that, any AppImage file found in one of those folders will be automatically made executable and available in your applications menu: - $HOME/Downloads (or its localized equivalent, as determined by G_USER_DIRECTORY_DOWNLOAD in glib) - $HOME/.local/bin - $HOME/bin - $HOME/Applications - /Applications - [any mounted partition]/Applications - /opt - /usr/local/bin Running \u00b6 If you have decided not to integrate AppImages with your system, you\u2019ll need to make the file executable. In GNOME 3, right-click on the file, select the Properties menu entry, go to the Permissions tab and enable the Execution checkbox. Or in a terminal: cd /dir/where/you/put/the/file && chmod +x *.AppImage ` On first run, the application should have configured itself to run automatically on system start. Where are the application files? \u00b6 Almost everything is in the *.AppImage file however, if you have installed appimaged , the following additional files are created: Launcher file in ~/.local/share/applications/appimagekit_<unique identifier>-Cozy_Drive.desktop Icons in ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/*/apps/appimagekit<same unique identifier>-cozydrive.png Everything else works the same as Windows or macOS: your synchronized files are in ~/Cozy Drive/ or the folder you choose on first run, and the hidden ~/.cozy-desktop/ folder contains the application configuration, metadata and logs. Displaying the app window \u00b6 To show the application preferences and the recently synchronized files list, you can either launch the app again (i.e. it will simply open the app\u2019s window as only one instance can run at a time) or click on the systray icon. If libappindicator is installed on your system, left-clicks won\u2019t have any effects so you need to do a right-click on the icon then select the Show Application menu entry. Note for GNOME Users From 3.26 onwards, GNOME removed the systray which is the only interface for Cozy Drive . It should be replaced in the future by libcloudprovider , which we will implement when it spreads. In the meantime, you need to install an extension providing support for appindicator.

Relations are referenced by their names. Each relation is an object with a data property containing either null , one reference or an array of references. A reference is an object containing at least a _type with the name of the referenced doctype and an _id with the id of the referenced document inside its doctype. { \"_id\" : \"mobydick\" , \"relationships\" : { \"authors\" : { \"data\" : [{ \"_id\" : \"hermanmelville\" , \"_type\" : \"io.cozy.contacts\" }] } } } External relationships \u00b6 Relationships that reference a document that lives outside the couchdb of the user will have a _type in a different namespace than io.cozy.* , and will have an additional _protocol field. At the moment the only available external relationship is bitwarden with the following format: { \"_id\" : \"secretsafe\" , \"relationships\" : { \"vaultCipher\" : { \"data\" : [{ \"_id\" : \"123abc\" , \"_type\" : \"com.bitwarden.ciphers\" , \"_protocol\" : \"bitwarden\" }] } } } Relationships with metadata \u00b6 A relationship can store additional information, in the metadata attribute. For instance, see the contracts relationship for the accounts. \"relationships\" : { \"contracts\" : { \"data\" : [ { \"_id\" : \"77b662b903f1bac7a78cf8cc12806479\" , \"_type\" : \"io.cozy.bank.accounts\" , \"metadata\" : { \"deletedByVendor\" : false , \"imported\" : true , \"label\" : \"Compte ch\u00e8que\" , \"vendorId\" : \"1337\" } } ] } } Document metadata \u00b6 We distinguish three levels of attributes: The data (e.g. a list of songs from a playlist) The metadata about the data (e.g. the creation date of the playlist itself) The metadata of the cozy document (e.g. the creation date of the cozy document describing the playlist). The third level is described by an object named cozyMetadata at the root of the document. This object structure is common to all Cozy doctypes. The expected cozyMetadata attributes are the following: doctypeVersion : Name or identifier for the version of the schema used by this document (ie: doctypeVersion: 2 for \u201cThis document conforms to io.cozy.contacts in its version 2\u201d) metadataVersion : Version of the cozyMetadata createdAt : Creation date of the cozy document createdByApp : Slug of the app or connector which created the document createdByAppVersion : Version identifier of the app updatedAt : Last modification date of the cozy document updatedByApps : List of objects representing the applications (slugs and versions) which modified the cozy document in its life and the last update date for each of those apps (one entry per slug, apps should just update the value) sourceAccount : When the document was imported from a connector, identifier of the account in io.cozy.accounts sourceAccountIdentifier : When the document was imported from a connector, identifier of the account on targeted web service (the email address most of the time) favorite : {boolean} whether or not the document is a favorite. \u2139\ufe0f All these attributes are optional and taken care by the apps modifying the document. Unless specified otherwise in the documentation of the doctype, all these attributes may not be present or may have a null value. \u2139\ufe0f For doctypes protected by the stack such as io.cozy.files , any non-expected attribute in cozyMetadata will be refused by the stack. { \"_id\" : \"xxxx\" , \"cozyMetadata\" : { \"doctypeVersion\" : 4 , \"metadataVersion\" : 1 , \"createdAt\" : \"xxxxx\" , \"createdByApp\" : \"xxxx\" , \"createdByAppVersion\" : \"xxxx\" , \"updatedAt\" : \"xxxxx\" , \"updatedByApps\" : [ { \"slug\" : \"xxxxx\" , \"date\" : \"xxxxx\" , \"version\" : 3 } ], \"sourceAccount\" : \"xxxxx\" , \"sourceAccountIdentifier\" : \"test@mail.fr\" } } Date format \u00b6 Date should be formatted in ISO8601 : 2017-04-22T01:00:00-05:00 \u2705 2017-04-22T01:00:00Z \u2705 2017-04-22 \u2705 2017-04-22 01:00 \u274c", "title": "README"}, {"location": "cozy-doctypes/docs/#doctypes", "text": "Doctypes represent different types of data.

Note this could be a relationship to the konnector manifest, but we keep this field for historical reasons. auth : {object} (Optional) Contains authentification data, typically a couple with login / password . This field should not be used when oauth is present. login : {string} (Optional) Main credentials field to use, displayed as default account name by harvest. Some konnectors do not use a login parameter, but identifier or email . In this case the attribute role: 'identifier' should be added to the parameter object in the konnector\u2019s manifest. accountName : {string} (Optional) If defined, will be used preferentially over login or email or the first konnerctor parameter with role: 'identifier' as the account name.

Here are the used values for now: TWOFA_NEEDED : The service is asking for a Two Factor connexion and the related code (sent by the service) must be provided by the user. This status can be further precised with its type. This allows the UI presented to the user to have custom messages, depending on the type of two factor authentication required by the vendor. TWOFA_NEEDED.EMAIL : If the two factor authentication is done by email TWOFA_NEEDED.SMS : If the two factor authentication is done by SMS TWOFA_NEEDED_RETRY : The 2FA code provided by the user is wrong, the user can retry by providing a new one. TWO_FA_NEEDED_RETRY.EMAIL and TWO_FA_NEEDED_RETRY.SMS can also be used. RESET_SESSION : By finding this state, the konnector should reset the login session if there is one stored and reset the state. twoFACode : When a 2FA code is asked by the service, Harvest will ask the user for it from and send it to the konnector via this attribute. mutedErrors : {array} (Optional) A list of errors that have been discarded by the user and will no longer be shown in the UI.

It is used to indicate that this accounts depends on another one. Generally, the konnector should be able to handle by itself this kind of relationshiop, like querying the database to get the information it needs. A parent relationship is aimed to be an account overriden by the account it is linked to, but it can also be use as an aggregator account.

It also has a relationship with its parent in the JSON-API representation. For an image , there are 3 links to thumbnails: small , medium , and large . These thumbnail links are valid for 10 minutes. After that, links will return a 400 Bad Request response code. Trash \u00b6 When a file or a directory is put in the trash bin, some attributes are updated: - trashed is set to true, but only for files: directories never have this attribute. - The restore_path is set, for both files and directories. - \u26a0\ufe0f The restore_path is not set on children. For instance, if a directory foo is trashed, it will have a restore_path but not the children. - The path is updated only for directories, starting with .cozy_trash Here is how one could query files and directories not in the trash, through a mango query: _id: { $ne: 'io.cozy.files.trash-dir' }, path: { $or: [{ $exists: false }, { $regex: '^(?!/.cozy_trash)' }] }, trashed: { $or: [{ $exists: false }, { $eq: false }] } References \u00b6 It\u2019s possible to link a file or a folder to another document. It\u2019s called a reference . It appears in the JSON-API representation as a refererenced_by relationship. CozyMetadata \u00b6 The io.cozy.files doctype has the standard cozyMetadata , but with some more fields: createdOn : {string} the instance URL on which the file has created (useful if the file is shared between several cozy instances) uploadedAt : {date} the server date/time of the last upload (when the content was changed) uploadedOn : {string} the instance URL on which the file content was changed the last time uploadedBy : {map} information on which app has made the last upload slug : {string} the slug of the application that has made the upload version : {string} the version number of this application oauthClient : {map} if the upload was made by an OAuth Client, information about it ( id , name , and kind ) Example (JSON-API format) \u00b6 { \"data\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.files\" , \"id\" : \"9152d568-7e7c-11e6-a377-37cbfb190b4b\" , \"meta\" : { \"rev\" : \"3-0e6d5b72\" }, \"attributes\" : { \"type\" : \"file\" , \"name\" : \"sunset.jpg\" , \"trashed\" : false , \"md5sum\" : \"ODZmYjI2OWQxOTBkMmM4NQo=\" , \"created_at\" : \"2018-01-02T20:38:04Z\" , \"updated_at\" : \"2019-06-12T12:38:04Z\" , \"tags\" : [], \"metadata\" : { \"datetime\" : \"2018-01-02T20:38:04Z\" , \"height\" : 1080 , \"width\" : 1920 , \"icon\" : \"<svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='32' height='32'><g fill='none' fill-rule='evenodd' transform='translate(0 2)'><rect width='32' height='26' y='2' fill='#B2D3FF' rx='2'/><path fill='#197BFF' d='M0 1a1 1 0 011-1h12c.55 0 1.31.31 1.71.71l.58.58c.4.4 1.15.71 1.71.71h13a2 2 0 012 2H17c-.55 0-1.31.31-1.71.71l-.58.58c-.4.4-1.16.71-1.72.71H1.01A1 1 0 010 5V1z'/></g></svg>\" }, \"size\" : 12 , \"executable\" : false , \"class\" : \"image\" , \"mime\" : \"image/jpg\" , \"cozyMetadata\" : { \"doctypeVersion\" : 1 , \"metadataVersion\" : 1 , \"createdAt\" : \"2019-06-11T01:02:03Z\" , \"createdByApp\" : \"flickr\" , \"createdByAppVersion\" : \"1.2.3\" , \"createdOn\" : \"https://alice.cozy.example\" , \"updatedAt\" : \"2019-06-12T12:40:06Z\" , \"updatedByApps\" : [ { \"slug\" : \"flickr\" , \"date\" : \"2019-06-11T01:02:03Z\" , \"version\" : \"1.2.3\" , \"instance\" : \"https://alice.cozy.example\" }, { \"slug\" : \"cozy-desktop\" , \"date\" : \"2019-06-12T12:40:06Z\" , \"version\" : \"3.13.2\" , \"instance\" : \"https://alice.cozy.example\" } ], \"uploadedAt\" : \"2019-06-11T20:34:56Z\" , \"uploadedOn\" : \"https://alice.cozy.example\" , \"uploadedBy\" : { \"slug\" : \"cozy-desktop\" , \"version\" : \"3.13.2\" , \"oauthClient\" : { \"id\" : \"9aaa6886-8b69-11e9-8412-b7855fb3838f\" , \"kind\" : \"desktop\" , \"name\" : \"Cozy Drive - mac book pro d'Alice\" } }, \"sourceAccount\" : \"07b49550-8b60-11e9-bb7e-87717e829039\" , \"sourceAccountIdentifier\" : \"157ae784\" } }, \"relationships\" : { \"parent\" : { \"links\" : { \"related\" : \"/files/fce1a6c0-dfc5-11e5-8d1a-1f854d4aaf81\" }, \"data\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.files\" , \"id\" : \"fce1a6c0-dfc5-11e5-8d1a-1f854d4aaf81\" } }, \"referenced_by\" : { \"links\" : { \"self\" : \"/files/fce1a6c0-dfc5-11e5-8d1a-1f854d4aaf81/relationships/references\" }, \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.albums\" , \"id\" : \"94375086-e2e2-11e6-81b9-5bc0b9dd4aa4\" } ] } }, \"links\" : { \"self\" : \"/files/9152d568-7e7c-11e6-a377-37cbfb190b4b\" , \"small\" : \"/files/9152d568-7e7c-11e6-a377-37cbfb190b4b/thumbnails/0f9cda56674282ac/small\" , \"medium\" : \"/files/9152d568-7e7c-11e6-a377-37cbfb190b4b/thumbnails/0f9cda56674282ac/medium\" , \"large\" : \"/files/9152d568-7e7c-11e6-a377-37cbfb190b4b/thumbnails/0f9cda56674282ac/large\" } } } Shortcuts \u00b6 Shortcuts (or hyperlinks) are a special type of files. They are served with the application/internet-shortcut mime-type, they have a .url extension, and respect the URL file format . They can have metadata : sharing.status will be set if the link can be used to open a sharing. 2 values are possible: new and seen , depending on whether the link has been opened. icon {string?} contains the base64 encoded image or svg binary if mimetype is not present. iconMimeType {string?} contains the mime-type of the icon. description : {string} the description of the shortcut (optional) An object target - target.cozyMetadata.instance is set to the cozy instance when relevant (mostly sharing and internal links) - target._type is the doctype of the destination of the link (when the link goes to a sharing or document inside a cozy) - target.mime is the mime-type of the destination of the link (when it is a file) - target.app is the slug of the destination app (internal links only). - target.title : {string} the title of the application where the shortcut redirects (optional) - target.category : {string} the category of the application where the shortcut redirects (optional) Example (JSON format) \u00b6 { \"_id\" : \"629fb233be550a21174ac8e19f0043af\" , \"_rev\" : \"1-61c7804bdb4f9f8dae5a363cb9a30dd8\" , \"type\" : \"file\" , \"name\" : \"sunset.jpg.url\" , \"dir_id\" : \"629fb233be550a21174ac8e19f003e4a\" , \"trashed\" : false , \"md5sum\" : \"vfEMDpJShs8QeIlsDmw9VA==\" , \"created_at\" : \"2020-02-10T20:38:04Z\" , \"updated_at\" : \"2020-02-10T20:38:04Z\" , \"tags\" : [], \"metadata\" : { \"sharing\" : { \"status\" : \"new\" }, \"target\" : { \"cozyMetadata\" : { \"instance\" : \"https://alice.cozy.example/\" }, \"_type\" : \"io.cozy.files\" , \"mime\" : \"image/jpg\" }, \"icon\" : \"[encoded base64 string of the content of the icon or svg binary]\" , \"iconMimeType\" : \"image/svg+xml\" }, \"size\" : 62 , \"executable\" : false , \"class\" : \"shortcut\" , \"mime\" : \"application/shortcut\" , \"cozyMetadata\" : { \"doctypeVersion\" : 1 , \"metadataVersion\" : 1 , \"createdAt\" : \"2020-02-10T20:38:04Z\" , \"createdOn\" : \"https://bob.cozy.example/\" , \"updatedAt\" : \"2020-02-10T20:38:04Z\" , \"uploadedAt\" : \"2020-02-10T20:38:04Z\" , \"uploadedOn\" : \"https://bob.cozy.example/\" } } Toutatice shortcuts \u00b6 The Toutatice konnector creates specific shortcuts for applications on the Toutatice store. This metadata is used to organize the display in the Home and Store applications. Generic data is stored in the target object with the following attributes: - title : {string} The title of the application to which the shortcut redirects - description : {string} A brief description of the application - category : {string} The category of the application (e.g., lien, info, triskell, perso). Each category corresponds to a sub-folder in the Home settings folder where the associated shortcuts are located. Additional information is stored in the externalDataSource object to maintain the link with the Toutatice object: - source : {string} The space to which the application belongs - networkAccess : {string} The access rights granted to the application - hubMetadata : {object} Contains various metadata fields: - derniereSynchronisation : {string} Date of the last synchronization - etat : {string} Current status of the application - favori : {boolean} Indicates if the application is marked as a favorite - idInterne : {string} Internal ID of the application - premiereSynchronisation : {string} Date of the first synchronization Example (JSON format) \u00b6 { \"_id\" : \"629fb233be550a21174ac8e19f0043af\" , \"_rev\" : \"1-61c7804bdb4f9f8dae5a363cb9a30dd8\" , \"type\" : \"file\" , \"name\" : \"\u00c9cole Directe.url\" , \"dir_id\" : \"90c6120de7cf25f9f87424e09fea4e13\" , \"created_at\" : \"2024-08-16T00:09:13.655513926Z\" , \"updated_at\" : \"2024-08-16T00:09:13.655513926Z\" , \"md5sum\" : \"BZcKfVhs0FWFJ9r7vxhJRg==\" , \"mime\" : \"application/internet-shortcut\" , \"class\" : \"shortcut\" , \"trashed\" : false , \"metadata\" : { \"target\" : { \"title\" : \"\u00c9cole Directe\" , \"description\" : \"Application de vie scolaire\" , \"category\" : \"lien\" }, \"externalDataSource\" : { \"networkAccess\" : \"ALL\" , \"source\" : \"Arena\" , \"hubMetadata\" : { \"derniereSynchronisation\" : \"2022-10-21T14:27:37.794654Z\" , \"etat\" : \"AFFECTEE\" , \"favori\" : false , \"idInterne\" : \"4ebec71e-814e-4638-8b7e-7c5117599851\" , \"premiereSynchronisation\" : \"2022-10-21T07:27:21.375402Z\" }, } }, \"cozyMetadata\" : { \"doctypeVersion\" : 1 , \"metadataVersion\" : 1 , \"createdAt\" : \"2020-02-10T20:38:04Z\" , \"createdByApp\" : \"toutatice\" , \"createdOn\" : \"https://bob.cozy.example/\" , \"updatedAt\" : \"2020-02-10T20:38:04Z\" , \"updatedByApps\" : [ { \"slug\" : \"toutatice\" , \"date\" : \"2020-02-10T20:38:04Z\" , \"instance\" : \"https://bob.cozy.example/\" } ], \"uploadedAt\" : \"2020-02-10T20:38:04Z\" , \"uploadedBy\" : { \"slug\" : \"toutatice\" }, \"uploadedOn\" : \"https://bob.cozy.example/\" } } io.cozy.files.versions \u00b6 The io.cozy.files.versions is used to track old versions of a file content, when files versioning is enabled. The attributes of a version are: size : {number} the size of its content, in bytes md5sum : {string} the checksum of its content, computed with the MD5 algorithm updated_at : {date} the date of the last update of this file given by the client tags : {array of strings} a list of tags metadata : {map} an optional map of metadata.

A qualification model is available here that describes the qualification attributes for a set of documents. A qualification consists of a label bound to some fixed attributes, i.e. purpose , sourceCategory , sourceSubCategory and subjects , all explained in the next section. Note that for a given label, it is possible to customize the model attributes values, by following these rules: If a value is defined for the attributes purpose , sourceCategory , sourceSubCategory , it is not possible to customize it. If a value is not defined for one of these attributes, a custom value can be defined, if it exists in their respective known values list in the model, e.g. knownSourceCategory . If some subjects values are set, they must be included in the given qualification. Extra subjects values can be set, but they should exist in the subjectsKnownValues model list. A document qualification is typically set by konnectors or by applications such as Cozy Drive through the cozy-scanner library. Data structure \u00b6 Example \u00b6 Here is a qualification example: { \"qualification\": { \"label\": \"driver_license\", \"purpose\": \"attestation\", \"sourceCategory\": \"gov\", \"sourceSubCategory\": \"transport\", \"subjects\": [\"permit\", \"driving\"] } } Qualification attributes \u00b6 A qualification can be composed of the following attributes: label : {string} the document label, which precisely specify what is the document. It is the only mandatory attribute in the qualification. Examples: driver_license , car_insurance , bank_statement , etc. purpose : {string} the goal of the document: for instance, an identity document has an attestation goal, to attest an identity. In the same manner, the purpose of a bill is to invoice something. Examples: attestation , invoice , contract , report , etc. sourceCategory : {string} the activity field of the source that produced the document. Examples: gov , bank , health , transport , etc. sourceSubCategory : {string} a precision of the activity field of the source that produced the document. In some cases, it is necessary when the primary field is too broad. Typically, for the driver_license label, gov is the sourceCategory and transport the sourceSubCategory . Examples: transport , health , civil_registration , health , etc. subjects : {array of strings} list what the document is about. For instance, a driver_license has two subjects: permit and driving , because this document is about the permit to drive a vehicle. Another example is the car_insurance : the subjects are insurance and car . Examples: permit , insurance , house , car , etc. For a complete list of the possible values for each attributes, see the qualification model . If you need to add new values, please consider opening an issue or making a pull request to the cozy-client repository. Additional metadata attributes \u00b6 Additional metadata attributes might be set to further describe the document. Most of these attributes heavily depends on the document context and are not expected in every cases. contentAuthor : {string} the author of the document, e.g. impots.gouv , amazon.com , etc. It is currently used as a source meaning. datetime : {date} Equals to the date attribute specified by datetimeLabel . description : {string} A file summary fileIdAttributes : {string} Used to deduplicate files imported by a konnector.

In an identity, data is grouped by category : contact, tax_information, housing, incomes\u2026 There are three sources of identity, considering the source of the data: source = connector : gathers the data held by the online service is the \u201cuser profile\u201d known by each different service source = manual : attributes manually modified byt the user are stored apart in a \u201cmanual\u201d identity document. There is only one manual identity. source = factorized : data from manual and connector identities are automatically factorized in a single identity of type \u201cfactorized\u201d. There is only one factorized identity. \u2139\ufe0f Whatever the source of the data, all identities must follow the same format, described below. Relation between Identities and Accounts \u00b6 There is one identity per identifier/slug couple: identifier is the unique identifier of the user account, often an email. slug is the brand An identity is associated to a unique io.cozy.accounts . \u2139\ufe0f Multiple connectors may create an identity for a given identifier. That is why an identity will be unique by identifier and slug. \u2139\ufe0f When an account is disconnected in a connector, then the associated CouchDB document is deleted, but not its corresponding identity. If the same \u201cuser account\u201d is connected again, then a new account is created but the corresponding identity is reused. The id of the corresponding account and the identifier of the account are in the .cozyMetadata: sourceAccount : id of the io.cozy.accounts document sourceAccountIdentifier : identifier of this account, for instance \u201cjo32@gmail.com\u201d \u2139\ufe0f The identifier is also stored in the identifier attribute (data is duplicated) Manual identity \u00b6 Data might be modified manually by the user, for instance when modifiying his own contact (i.e. myself contact). Data modified by the user is stored in the \u201cmanual identity\u201d. The identity factorization service will then be able to choose which data should be put into the factorized identity. Factorized identity \u00b6 Data from different identities is factored into a single identity called the \u201cfactorized identity\u201d. It is an identity where source = factorized . For instance, if a user has different email addresses in different online services, only one of these will be chosen to be factorized in the \u201cfactorized identity\u201d. And if the user modifies his email address, then this one will be stored in the \u201cmanual identity\u201d and will be prioritized into the \u201cfactorized identity\u201d to be chosen as default. A service (WIP) is in charge of updating this factorized identity each time a modification occurs in an identity.

A false or null value in scope will remove any scope parameter in the request sent to the oauth provider. parameters (konnector specific) Additional parameters which should be passed to the konnector. Used for example for bank konnectors to pass a bankId parameter. partnership an object to provide informations (to display in the Store for example) about a partnership related to the application ( icon description , name and domain ). It can also be used to trigger alternative konnector connection policies for some vendors (see the budget-insight konnector policy in cozy-harvest ). permissions a map of permissions needed by the app (see see cozy-stack permissions doc for more details) platforms (application specific) List of objects for platform native applications. For now there are only two properties: type (i.e. 'ios' or 'linux' ) and the optional url to reach this application page. qualification_labels (konnector specific) Array of one or more labels from the Cozy Client\u2019s qualifications list to associate with the files the konnector will receive from the website. routes (application specific) a map of routes for the app (see cozy-stack routes doc for more details) ( REQUIRED ) screenshots an array of paths to the screenshots of the application (paths in the build) services (application specific) a map of the services associated with the app (see cozy-stack services doc for more details) slug the default slug that should never change (alpha-numeric lowercase) ( REQUIRED ) source where the files of the app can be downloaded (by default it will look for the branch build ) terms an object defining properties for terms that need to be displayed/accepted by the user when installing the application ( more-info-below ) time_interval (konnector specific) By defaults, konnector triggers are scheduled randomly between 00:00 AM and 05:00 AM. Those two values can be overwritten thanks to this property, by passing an array containing two values: first is the interval start hour, second is the interval end hour. Example: [15, 21] will randomly schedule the konnector trigger between 15:00 (03:00 PM) and 21:00 (09:00 PM).

There are many ways to contribute, and we appreciate all of them. Security Issues \u00b6 If you discover a security issue, please bring it to our attention right away! Please DO NOT file a public issue, instead send your report privately to security AT cozycloud DOT cc. Security reports are greatly appreciated and we will publicly thank you for it. We currently do not offer a paid security bounty program, but are not ruling it out in the future. Bug Reports \u00b6 While bugs are unfortunate, they\u2019re a reality in software. We can\u2019t fix what we don\u2019t know about, so please report liberally. If you\u2019re not sure if something is a bug or not, feel free to file a bug anyway. Opening an issue is as easy as following this link and filling out the fields. Here are some things you can write about your bug: A short summary What did you try, step by step? What did you expect? What did happen instead? What is the version of the Cozy Drive? Pull Requests \u00b6 Please keep in mind that: Pull-Requests point to the master branch You need to cover your code and feature by tests You may add documentation in the /docs directory to explain your choices if needed We recommend to use [task lists][checkbox] to explain steps / features in your Pull-Request description you do not need to build app to submit a PR you should update the Transifex source locale file if you modify it for your feature needs (see Localization section in README ) Workflow \u00b6 Pull requests are the primary mechanism we use to change Cozy. GitHub itself has some great documentation on using the Pull Request feature. We use the fork and pull model described there. Step 1: Fork \u00b6 Fork the project on GitHub and check out your copy locally . $ git clone github.com/cozy/cozy-home.git $ cd cozy-home $ git remote add fork git://github.com/yourusername/cozy-home.git Step 2: Branch \u00b6 Create a branch and start hacking: $ git checkout -b my-branch origin/master Step 3: Code \u00b6 Well, we think you know how to do that. Just be sure to follow the coding guidelines from the community ( standard JS , comment the code, etc). Step 4: Test \u00b6 Don\u2019t forget to add tests and be sure they are green: $ cd cozy-home $ npm run test Step 5: Commit \u00b6 Writing good commit messages is important. A commit message should describe what changed and why. Step 6: Rebase \u00b6 Use git rebase ( not git merge ) to sync your work from time to time. $ git fetch origin $ git rebase origin/master my-branch Step 7: Push \u00b6 $ git push -u fork my-branch Go to https://github.com/yourusername/cozy-home and select your branch. Click the \u2018Pull Request\u2019 button and fill out the form. Alternatively, you can use hub to open the pull request from your terminal: $ git pull-request -b master -m \"My PR message\" -o Pull requests are usually reviewed within a few days. If there are comments to address, apply your changes in a separate commit and push that to your branch. Post a comment in the pull request afterwards; GitHub doesn\u2019t send out notifications when you add commits. Writing documentation \u00b6 Documentation improvements are very welcome. We try to keep a good documentation in the /docs folder. But, you know, we are developers, we can forget to document important stuff that look obvious to us. And documentation can always be improved. Translations \u00b6 Localization and translations are handled by Transifex , which is used by all Cozy\u2019s apps. As a translator , you can login to Transifex (using your Github account) and claim an access to the app repository . Transifex will then create pull request on the repository, and the locales are merged after validating the pull request. This tutorial can help you to learn how to make your first steps here. If you have any question, don\u2019t hesitate to ask us! As a developer , you just have to modify json in /src/locales . New locales will be automatically added to Transifex. If you need to pull or push manually locales, you can use Transifex CLI . If you were using a transifex-client , you must move to Transifex CLI to be compatible with the v3 API. Community \u00b6 You can help us by making our community even more vibrant. For example, you can write a blog post, take some videos, answer the questions on the forum , organize new meetups, and speak about what you like in Cozy!", "title": "How to contribute to Cozy Home?"}, {"location": "cozy-home/CONTRIBUTING/#how-to-contribute-to-cozy-home", "text": "Thank you for your interest in contributing to Cozy!

Will create io.cozy.bills objects. The default deduplication keys are ['date', 'amount', 'vendor'] . You need the full permission on io.cozy.bills , full permission on io.cozy.files and also full permission on io.cozy.bank.operations in your manifest, to be able to use this function. Parameters: documents is an array of objects with any attributes with some mandatory attributes : amount (Number): the amount of the bill used to match bank operations date (Date): the date of the bill also used to match bank operations vendor (String): the name of the vendor associated to the bill. Ex: \u2018trainline\u2019 currency (String) default: EUR: The ISO currency value (not mandatory since there is a default value. contractId (String): Contract unique identicator used to deduplicate bills contractLabel : (String) User label if define, must be used with contractId matchingCriterias (Object): criterias that can be used by an external service to match bills with bank operations. If not specified but the \u2018banksTransactionRegExp\u2019 attribute is specified in the manifest of the connector, this value is automatically added to the bill You can also pass attributes expected by saveFiles : fileurl, filename, requestOptions and more Please take a look at io.cozy.bills doctype documentation - fields (object) this is the first parameter given to BaseKonnector\u2019s constructor - options is passed directly to saveFiles , hydrateAndFilter , addData and linkBankOperations . Kind : Exported function Example const { BaseKonnector , saveBills } = require ( 'cozy-konnector-libs' ) module . exports = new BaseKonnector ( function fetch ( fields ) { const documents = [] // some code which fills documents return saveBills ( documents , fields , { identifiers : [ 'vendor' ] }) }) saveFiles \u00b6 Saves the given files in the given folder via the Cozy API. saveFiles(entries, fields, options, [contract]) \u23cf \u00b6 Saves the files given in the fileurl attribute of each entries You need the full permission on io.cozy.files in your manifest to use this function. Kind : Exported function Param Type Description entries Array list of object describing files to save entries.fileurl string The url of the file (can be a function returning the value). Ignored if filestream is given entries.fetchFile function the connector can give it\u2019s own function to fetch the file from the website, which will be run only when necessary (if the corresponding file is missing on the cozy) function returning the stream). This function must return a promise resolved as a stream entries.filestream object | string the stream which will be directly passed to cozyClient.files.create (can also be function returning the stream) entries.requestOptions object The options passed to request to fetch fileurl (can be a function returning the value) entries.filename string The file name of the item written on disk. This attribute is optional and as default value, the file name will be \u201csmartly\u201d guessed by the function. Use this attribute if the guess is not smart enough for you, or if you use filestream (can be a function returning the value). entries.shouldReplaceName string used to migrate filename. If saveFiles finds a file linked to this entry and this file name matches shouldReplaceName , the file is renamed to filename (can be a function returning the value) entries.shouldReplaceFile function use this function to state if the current entry should be forced to be redownloaded and replaced. Usefull if we know the file content can change and we always want the last version. entries.fileAttributes object ex: {created_at: new Date()} sets some additionnal file attributes passed to cozyClient.file.create entries.subPath string A subpath to save all files, will be created if needed. entries.contract object contract object associated to the files entries.contract.id string id of the contract entries.contract.name string name of the contract fields object is the argument given to the main function of your connector by the BaseKonnector. It especially contains a folderPath which is the string path configured by the user in collect/home options object global options options.timeout number timestamp which can be used if your connector needs to fetch a lot of files and if the stack does not give enough time to your connector to fetch it all. It could happen that the connector is stopped right in the middle of the download of the file and the file will be broken. With the timeout option, the saveFiles function will check if the timeout has passed right after downloading each file and then will be sure to be stopped cleanly if the timeout is not too long. And since it is really fast to check that a file has already been downloaded, on the next run of the connector, it will be able to download some more files, and so on. If you want the timeout to be in 10s, do Date.now() + 10*1000 . You can try it in the previous code. options.contentType number | boolean ex: \u2018application/pdf\u2019 used to force the contentType of documents when they are badly recognized by cozy. If \u201ctrue\u201d the content type will be recognized from the file name and forced the same way. options.concurrency number default: 1 sets the maximum number of concurrent downloads options.validateFile function default: do not validate if file is empty or has bad mime type options.validateFileContent boolean | function default false. Also check the content of the file to recognize the mime type options.fileIdAttributes Array array of strings : Describes which attributes of files will be taken as primary key for files to check if they already exist, even if they are moved. If not given, the file path will used for deduplication as before. options.subPath string A subpath to save this file, will be created if needed. [contract] object contract object associated to the file [contract.id] string id of the contract [contract.name] string name of the contract options.fetchFile function the connector can give it\u2019s own function to fetch the file from the website, which will be run only when necessary (if the corresponding file is missing on the cozy) function returning the stream). This function must return a promise resolved as a stream options.verboseFilesLog boolean the connector will send saveFiles result as a warning Example await saveFiles ([{ fileurl : 'https://...' , filename : 'bill1.pdf' }], fields , { fileIdAttributes : [ 'fileurl' ] }) saveIdentity \u00b6 Helper to set or merge io.cozy.identities See https://github.com/cozy/cozy-doctypes/blob/master/docs/io.cozy.identities.md saveIdentity() \u23cf \u00b6 Set or merge a io.cozy.identities You need full permission for the doctype io.cozy.identities in your manifest, to be able to use this function.

It is the login most of the time const { saveIdentity } = require ( 'cozy-konnector-libs' ) const identity = { contact : { name : 'toto' , email : { 'address' : 'toto@example.com' } } } return saveIdentity ( identity , fields . login ) Kind : Exported function signin \u00b6 Provides an handy method to log the user in, on HTML form pages. On success, it resolves to a promise with a parsed body. signin() \u23cf \u00b6 Provides an handy method to log the user in, on HTML form pages. On success, it resolves to a promise with a parsed body. Errors: LOGIN_FAILED if the validate predicate is false INVALID_FORM if the element matched by formSelector is not a form or has no action attribute UNKNOWN_PARSING_STRATEGY if parse is not one of the accepted values: raw , cheerio , json . VENDOR_DOWN if a request throws a RequestError, or StatusCodeError It does not submit values provided through select tags, except if populated by user with formData . url is the url to access the html form formSelector is used by cheerio to uniquely identify the form in which to log in formData is an object { name: value, \u2026 } . It is used to populate the form, in the proper inputs with the same name as the properties of this object, before submitting it. It can also be a function that returns this object. The page at url would be given as argument, right after having been parsed through cheerio . parse allow the user to resolve signin with a preparsed body. The choice of the strategy for the parsing is one of : raw , json or cheerio . cheerio being the default. validate is a predicate taking three arguments statusCode , parsedBody and fullResponse . If it is false, LOGIN_FAILED is thrown, otherwise the signin resolves with parsedBody value. requestOpts allows to pass eventual options to the signin \u2018s requestFactory . It could be useful for pages using latin1 encoding for instance. Kind : Exported function Example == basic example : == const $ = signin ({ url : `http://quotes.toscrape.com/login` , formSelector : 'form' , formData : { username , password } }) If the behavior of the targeted website is not standard. You can pass a validate function which will allow you to: - detect if the credentials work or not -> LOGIN_FAILED - detect if actions from the user are needed -> USER_ACTION_NEEDED - detect if the targeted website is out -> VENDOR_DOWN Example const $ = signin ({ url : `http://quotes.toscrape.com/login` , formSelector : 'form' , formData : { username , password }, validate : ( statusCode , $ , fullResponse ) { if ( statusCode !== 200 ) return false // LOGIN_FAILED if ( $ ( '.cgu' ). length ) throw new Error ( 'USER_ACTION_NEEDED' ) if ( fullResponse . request . uri . href . includes ( 'error' )) throw new Error ( 'VENDOR_DOWN' ) } }) Do not forget that the use of the signin function is not mandatory in a connector and won\u2019t work if the signin page does not use html forms. Here, a simple POST request may be a lot more simple. solveCaptcha \u00b6 Use every possible means to solve a captcha.

The connector will have to handle itself it\u2019s own exection and error handling Example const { BaseKonnector } = require ( 'cozy-konnector-libs' ) module . exports = new BaseKonnector ( function fetch () { // use this to access the instance of the konnector to // store any information that needs to be passed to // different stages of the konnector return request ( 'http://ameli.fr' ) . then ( computeReimbursements ) . then ( saveBills ) }) baseKonnector.run() \u00b6 Entrypoint of the konnector Initializes connector attributes Awaits this.main Ensures errors are handled via this.fail Calls this.end when the main function succeeded Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector baseKonnector.main() \u21d2 Promise \u00b6 Main runs after konnector has been initialized. Errors thrown will be automatically handled. Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector Returns : Promise - - The konnector is considered successful when it resolves baseKonnector.end() \u00b6 Hook called when the connector has ended successfully Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector baseKonnector.fail() \u00b6 Hook called when the connector fails Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector baseKonnector.readPayload() \u21d2 Object | null \u00b6 Read an eventual payload from COZY_PAYLOAD env var, wether it is a JSON string or a reference to a file containing a JSON string Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector Returns : Object | null - Promise<> result of JSON.parse from the JSON string or null if no payload baseKonnector.initAttributes() \u00b6 Initializes konnector attributes that will be used during its lifetime this._account this.fields Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector baseKonnector.saveAccountData(data, options) \u21d2 Promise \u00b6 Saves data to the account that is passed to the konnector. Use it to persist data that needs to be passed to each konnector run. By default, the data is merged to the remote data, use options.merge = false to overwrite the data. The data is saved under the .data attribute of the cozy account. Don\u2019t forget to modify the manifest.konnector file to give the right to write on the io.cozy.accounts doctype. The syntax can be : \"permissions\": {\"accounts\": {\"type\": \"io.cozy.accounts\"}} (here we juste removed the verb GET ) Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector Returns : Promise - : resolved with the modified account Param Type Description data object Attributes to be merged options object { merge: true baseKonnector.getAccountData() \u21d2 object \u00b6 Get the data saved by saveAccountData Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector Returns : object - the account data baseKonnector.updateAccountAttributes() \u00b6 Update account attributes and cache the account Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector baseKonnector.setTwoFAState(options) \u00b6 Sets the 2FA state, according to the type passed. Doing so resets the twoFACode field Typically you should not use that directly, prefer to use waitForTwoFaCode since the wait for user input will be handled for you. It is useful though for the \u201capp\u201d type where no user input (inside Cozy) is needed. Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector Param Type Description options object The list of options options.type string Used by the front to show the right message (email/sms/app/app_code) options.retry boolean Is this function call a retry ? This changes the resulting message to the user baseKonnector.resetTwoFAState() \u00b6 Resets 2FA state when not needed anymore Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector baseKonnector.waitForTwoFaCode(options) \u21d2 Promise \u00b6 Notices that 2FA code is needed and wait for the user to submit it. It uses the account to do the communication with the user. Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector Returns : Promise - Contains twoFa code entered by user Throws : Will throw USER_ACTION_NEEDED.TWOFA_EXPIRED if the konnector job is not run manually (we assume that not run manually means that we do not have a graphic interface to fill the required information) Will throw USER_ACTION_NEEDED.TWOFA_EXPIRED if 2FA is not filled by the user soon enough Param Type Description options object The list of options options.type string (default: \u201cemail\u201d) - Type of the expected 2FA code. The message displayed to the user will depend on it. Possible values: email, sms options.timeout number (default 3 minutes after now) - After this date, the stop will stop waiting and and an error will be shown to the user (deprecated and alias of endTime) options.endTime number (default 3 minutes after now) - After this timestamp, the home will stop waiting and and an error will be shown to the user options.heartBeat number (default: 5000) - How many milliseconds between each code check options.retry boolean (default: false) - Is it a retry. If true, an error message will be displayed to the user Example const { BaseKonnector } = require ( 'cozy-konnector-libs' ) module . exports = new BaseKonnector ( start ) async function start () { // we detect the need of a 2FA code const code = this . waitForTwoFaCode ({ type : 'email' }) // send the code to the targeted site } baseKonnector.notifySuccessfulLogin() \u00b6 Tells Cozy-Home that we have successfully logged in. Useful when auto-success has been deactivated. See deactivateAutoSuccess Kind : instance method of BaseKonnector baseKonnector.deactivateAutoSuccessfulLogin() \u00b6 By default, cozy-home considers that the konnector has successfully logged in when the konnector has run for more than 8s. This is problematic for 2FA since the konnector can sit idle, just waiting for the 2FA to come back. When this method is called, cozy-home is notified and will not consider the absence of error after 8s to be a success. Afterwards, to notify cozy-home when the user has logged in successfully, for example, after the user has entered 2FA codes, it is necessary to call notifySuccessfulLogin . Does nothing if called more than once.

This attribute is optional and as default value, the file name will be \u201csmartly\u201d guessed by the function. Use this attribute if the guess is not smart enough for you, or if you use filestream (can be a function returning the value). entries.shouldReplaceName string used to migrate filename.

It especially contains a folderPath which is the string path configured by the user in collect/home options object global options options.timeout number timestamp which can be used if your connector needs to fetch a lot of files and if the stack does not give enough time to your connector to fetch it all. It could happen that the connector is stopped right in the middle of the download of the file and the file will be broken. With the timeout option, the saveFiles function will check if the timeout has passed right after downloading each file and then will be sure to be stopped cleanly if the timeout is not too long. And since it is really fast to check that a file has already been downloaded, on the next run of the connector, it will be able to download some more files, and so on.

You first need an installed [nodejs] (LTS version is fine). And the last version of yarn : npm install --global yarn Then just run : yarn yarn standalone The requests to the cozy-stack will be stubbed using the [./fixture.json] file as source of data and when cozy-client is asked to create or update data, the data will be output to the console. The bills (or any file) will be saved in the . directory.

By default, the cozy-stack is supposed to be located in http://cozy.tools:8080. If this is not your case, just update the COZY_URL field in [./konnector-dev-config.json].

You can also add js comments in this json configuration file, they will be stripped out when read by cozy-jobs-cli Now run yarn dev one more time, it should be ok. The files are saved in the root directory of your cozy by default. How does the cozy-stack run the connector ? \u00b6 The cozy-stack runs the connector in a nsjail container to be sure it does not affect the environment. The connector is run by calling yarn start with the following envrionment variables : COZY_CREDENTIALS needs to be the result of cozy-stack instances token-cli <instance name> <scope> COZY_URL is the full http or https url to your cozy COZY_FIELDS contains context information for the konnector. Here is an example: { \"data\" : { \"attributes\" : { \"arguments\" : { \"account\" : \"cf31eaef5d899404a7e8c3737c1c2d1f\" , \"folder_to_save\" : \"folderPathId\" , \"slug\" : \"mykonnector\" } } } } The \u201caccount\u201d field is the id of the record with doctype \u201cio.cozy.accounts\u201d which will be used as parameters for your konnector. Build (without Travis) \u00b6 To be able to run the connector, the cozy stack needs a connector which is built into only one file, without needing to install its dependencies, this will be a lot faster to install. There is a command in package.json to help you to do that : yarn build This command uses [webpack] to bundle all the code needed by your connector into one file. This will generate an index.js file in the build directory and add all files the connector will need. You can deploy this build by using the specific script : yarn deploy This command will commit and push your build in the branch build fo your project. And your konnector can now be installed using the following url : git://github.com/konnectors/cozy-konnector- .git#build Build using Travis CI \u00b6 This project contains a .travis.yml config file which allows you to build your connector automatically using [Travis-CI][travis]. You can follow these steps to enable building using Travis: On your [travis-ci.org][travis] account, find your project name (should be the same than your Github repository) and enable Travis by using the related checkbox. Once enabled, go to this project on Travis by clicking on it and go to the \u201cSettings\u201d menu by using the \u201cMore options\u201d menu at the top right. Enable these three options: \u201cBuild only if .travis.yml is present\u201d \u201cBuild branch updates\u201d (run Travis after each branch update) \u201cBuild pull request updates\u201d (run Travis after each Pull Request update) Then, you have to generate a Github token in your Github account settings .

This process has at least two major flows : * We are always synchronizing all the data provided by the external service. * When something is modified (for example, the name of the stored file, it\u2019s almost sure that the previous one will be kept and that we\u2019ll have a duplicate) Another side effect could be that in a very large set of documents to synchronize, the whole process may take more than 3 minutes and never synchronize documents at the end of the list. Current usage \u00b6 When saving bills, cozy-konnector-libs provides a filtering and hydratation mechanism, to avoid overriding existing bills. It is done in function hydrateAndFilters . This method performs two actions : * hydrate entries retrieved from service with usable data from couchDB (like existing bill id) * filter entries retrieved from service and return only entries that need to be saved/synchronized. Objectives of this document \u00b6 The goals of this document are: Define a common way to store synchronization data for all konnector Propose a naive implementation for an abstract synchronisation data storing mechanism, provided by cozy-konnector-libs Propose a solution to synchronize every type of data or file, not only bills Taking the hydrateAndFilter function as basis, split it in three functions performing the following tasks : actual filtering, synchronization data hydratation and saving/updating current database document with correspondig external entries (the part done by the actual hydratation ) Storing synchronization data in documents \u00b6 Before saving any data or file, we will add in the relying document every synchronization data we will need. The added data will depend on how the service the konnector connects to retrieve entries and which information they gave us. Simple case, by id \u00b6 We suppose that in the most cases, we will face to entries provinding their own id attribute. The idea is to store it as synchronization data to be able to easily retrieve them later. To store synchronization data, we are using a sync attribute in document metadata attribute. Example: { \"metadata\" : { \"sync\" : { \"id\" : \"7ee401e841c94159addb47f190903139\" , \"konnector\" : \"trainline\" , \"last_sync\" : \"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 16:25:34 GMT\" } } } The expected information to be save is: field role id The id of the document, but given by the external service. If the external service does not provide any id or uuid, it could be interesting to generate one, with an hash of the file for example. konnector The slug of the konnector (Example: trainline , freemobile , cic ). This could be very useful to retrieve data synchronized with this konnector. last_sync Date of last synchronization, set to now() when storage is made. By multiple attributes \u00b6 If the external service does not provide any id attribute, we may need to use instead a list of attributes, for example firstname , lastname , dateofbirth . { \"metadata\" : { \"sync\" : { \"firstname\" : \"Claude\" , \"lastname\" : \"Causi\" , \"dateofbirth\" : \"06/12/1980\" } } } As we cannot be sure that we will have different data, it could be better to use a custom way of providing an unique identifier. By custom method \u00b6 When the external service does not provide any identifier, we have to use a custom method to generate one. It could be for example the filename or a hash generated with the document content. { \"metadata\" : { \"sync\" : { \"id:\" : \"customhash34FED5465645ABF54656FCB\" } } } Saving document based on synchronization strategy \u00b6 To solve the synchronization process we need to: * be able to add synchronization data on any type of document * be able to compare external entries to current database state * provide a default implementation while letting the contributors to define their own ones Adding synchronization data \u00b6 We should provide an addSyncData function could, which look like this (naive implementation, this piece of code needs to be improved to handle cases where synchronizationStrategy.idAttribute is an array or a function): const addSyncData = ( document , entry , synchronizationStrategy ) => { return { ... document , metadata : { ... document . metadata , id : entry [ synchronizationStrategy . idAttribute ] } } ```` Where `document` is the future document to save , `entry` the corresponding external entry , and `synchronizationStrategy` and object defining the synchronization properties and methods ( see below ). ### Filtering entries Now we have saved our documents in database with consistent synchronization metadata , we need to provide a way to filter external entries . We should provide a `filterEntriesToSynchronize` which returns a list of entries with new data or data to update . As `addSyncData` , this method will receive a `synchronizationStrategy` . The filtering algorithm should be based on the returned value of `synchronizationStrategy.shouldSave` and `synchronizationStrategy.shouldUpdate` . > \u26a0\ufe0f As the `synchronizationStrategy.shouldSave` and `synchronizationStrategy.shouldUpdate` will be asynchronous methods , `filterEntriesToSynchronize` should also be asynchronous . A naive example of `filterEntriesToSynchronize` implementation should be : ```js const filterEntriesToSynchronize = async (cozy, entries, synchronizationStrategy) = { const filtered = [] entries.forEach(entry => { // getExistingSynchronizedDocument needs to be implemented, it should retrieve // existing document from database, based on synchronization data. const existingDocument = cozy.getExistingSynchronizedDocument(entry, synchronizationStrategy) const toSave = await synchronizationStrategy.shouldSave(entry, existingDocument) const toUpdate = await synchronizationStrategy.shouldUpdate(entry, existingDocument) if (toSave || toUpdate) filtered.push(entry) }) return filtered } Synchronization strategy \u00b6 For our functions or methods dealing with synchronization, we pass a synchronizationStrategy object. Internally, we will use a default one but let the ability to contributors to pass their own ones. It is a simple object containing the following properties: Option Role disableSyncData (boolean) Disable storage of synchronization data. Default: false findLegacyDocument (function) Custom function which a konnector may use to look for a legacy document. Default is null . See below for more details. getSyncData (function) A mapping method returning additional synchronization data which have to be added to the document. idAttribute (string|Array|function) How the identifier attribute is named in the entry. Default value: id . See below for additional customization konnector Mandatory (string) The slug (or better, an uuid) of the current konnector. shouldSave (function) A method taking current entry and matching document in database to evaluate if an entry has to be saved in database. See below default method and customization. shouldUpdate (function) A method taking current entry and matching document in database to evaluate if a document must be updated with current entry. See below for default method and customization. findLegacyDocument \u00b6 If a document has not been saved yet with actual synchronization data, we will have no way to retrieve it, except by providing a findLegacyDocument function to saveEntry options. This signature of a findLegacyDocument function is: async function ( entry , cozy ) => { /* look for your document */ } ```` The `cozy` parameter is an instance of Cozy - Client . The idea is for example to retrive a document by its file path or any other accurate information . ### getSyncData This method returns any addtional synchronization data the konnector should need . Default method should be something returning an empty object or `null` . ```js (entry) => ({}) A konnector should provide its own method: { getSyncData : ( entry ) => ({ filename : entry . name }) } ``` ### idAttribute #### String Name of the id attribute in entry. Default is ` id `. If we want to use another name, we may use: ``` js saveFiles ( files , { idAttribute : 'uuid' }) Array \u00b6 This attribute may also be an array of string, defining each entry attribute which must be used for identifier. Example \u00b6 saveFiles ( files , { idAttribute : [ 'name' , 'author' , 'date' ]}) In this case, all fields are used in synchronization data. function \u00b6 When an entry does not provide an unique identifer, it is possible to use a function as idAttribute to customize the way the unique identifer is generated. Example \u00b6 addData ( file , { idAttribute : ( entry ) => hash ( entry )}) // hash() is a custom method hashing the current file. konnector \u00b6 The konnector attribute is used as a key reference to retrieve all document synchronized by this konnector. For now, the konnector option will be needed for every call. But it could be interesting to initialize some kind of runner with it, which may encapsulate all the cozy-konnector-libs functions. shouldSave \u00b6 The shouldSave function returns a boolean which indicate if the entry should be saved. The default method should be: async function shouldSave ( entry , existingDocument , cozy ) => { return Promise . resolve ( ! existingDocument ) } When calling this function, it is assumed that cozy-konnector-libs first queries the database for an exisring document, based on synchronization data and pass the document resulting the query to the shouldSave function, event if this document is null . We pass the whole document, and not only synchronization data, to let the contributors free on their way they are determining it a document should be saved. As a third parameter, a cozyClient instance is passed, it may be used by a konnector to perform another query. Because of this third parameter, the whole shouldSave method is asynchronous. shouldUpdate \u00b6 The shouldUpdate function acts exactly like shouldSave , except that it is used to determine if a document should be updated. By default, we make the choice to never update a document (except if it does not have synchronization data, see findLegacyDocument above). But some konnectors like Linxo related ones need to update existing documents. The default method is: async function shouldUpdate ( entry , existingDocument , cozy ) { // Update an existing document only if it does not have synchronization data const hasSyncData = !! existingDocument && !! existingDocument . metadata && !! existingDocument . metadata . sync return Promise . resolve ( ! hasSyncData ) } ```` ## Whole example As the way data are saved from `cozy-konnector-libs` differs based on data type , we let the saving mechanism to others functions or methods . For example , in existing codebase , bills are saved in a specific way , resulting in two documents in database . However , we could provide top - level functions or methods , like `synchronizeBills` or a more generic `synchronizeData` . Here is a whole and naive example of how `synchronizeBills` could be implemebted : ```js const synchronizeBills = async (cozy, entries, synchronizationStrategy) => { return await filteredEntries = await filterEntriesToSynchronize(cozy, entries, synchronizationStrategy) .then(filteredEntries => filteredEntries.map(entry => addSyncData(entry, synchronizationStrategy))) // existing saveBills method (with maybe some little changes) .saveBills(synchronizedDocuments) } Usage could be: synchronizeBills(cozy, entries, { findLegacyDocument: (entry, cozy) => { return cozy.files.statByPath(getEntryPath(entry)) }, getSyncData: (file) => ({ fileName: file.name }), idAttribute: 'uuid', konnector: 'myservice', shouldSave: (file) => { // For whatever reason we only save files created after 2010 return Promise.resolve(moment(file.creationDate).year().isAfter(2010)) }, shouldUpdate: (file, existingDocument) => { const hasBeenModified = moment(file.modificationDate).isAfter(existingDocument.metadata.sync.last_sync) return Promise.resolve(hasBeenModified) } }) Every synchronized document will contain: { \"metadata\" : { \"sync\" : { \"konnector\" : \"myservice\" , \"id\" : \"<entry_id>\" , \"last_sync\" : \"<now>\" , \"fileName\" : \"<fileName>\" } } }", "title": "Synchronization"}, {"location": "cozy-konnector-libs/synchronization/#table-of-contents", "text": "Konnector synchronisation data and options Problems Current usage Objectives of this document Storing synchronization data in documents Simple case, by id By multiple attributes By custom method Saving document based on synchronization strategy Adding synchronization data Filtering entries Synchronization strategy findLegacyDocument getSyncData Array Example function Example konnector shouldSave shouldUpdate Whole example", "title": "Table of contents"}, {"location": "cozy-konnector-libs/synchronization/#konnector-synchronisation-data-and-options", "text": "", "title": "Konnector synchronisation data and options"}, {"location": "cozy-konnector-libs/synchronization/#problems", "text": "Except bank konnectors which are already solving the addressed problem, all konnectors are currently processing data they are collecting in the same way: Get all data to synchronize Store it in CouchDB, even if it means overriding previously synchronized data.

If we want to use another name, we may use: ``` js saveFiles ( files , { idAttribute : 'uuid' })", "title": "findLegacyDocument"}, {"location": "cozy-konnector-libs/synchronization/#array", "text": "This attribute may also be an array of string, defining each entry attribute which must be used for identifier.", "title": "Array"}, {"location": "cozy-konnector-libs/synchronization/#example", "text": "saveFiles ( files , { idAttribute : [ 'name' , 'author' , 'date' ]}) In this case, all fields are used in synchronization data.", "title": "Example"}, {"location": "cozy-konnector-libs/synchronization/#function", "text": "When an entry does not provide an unique identifer, it is possible to use a function as idAttribute to customize the way the unique identifer is generated.", "title": "function"}, {"location": "cozy-konnector-libs/synchronization/#example_1", "text": "addData ( file , { idAttribute : ( entry ) => hash ( entry )}) // hash() is a custom method hashing the current file.", "title": "Example"}, {"location": "cozy-konnector-libs/synchronization/#konnector", "text": "The konnector attribute is used as a key reference to retrieve all document synchronized by this konnector. For now, the konnector option will be needed for every call. But it could be interesting to initialize some kind of runner with it, which may encapsulate all the cozy-konnector-libs functions.", "title": "konnector"}, {"location": "cozy-konnector-libs/synchronization/#shouldsave", "text": "The shouldSave function returns a boolean which indicate if the entry should be saved. The default method should be: async function shouldSave ( entry , existingDocument , cozy ) => { return Promise . resolve ( ! existingDocument ) } When calling this function, it is assumed that cozy-konnector-libs first queries the database for an exisring document, based on synchronization data and pass the document resulting the query to the shouldSave function, event if this document is null . We pass the whole document, and not only synchronization data, to let the contributors free on their way they are determining it a document should be saved. As a third parameter, a cozyClient instance is passed, it may be used by a konnector to perform another query. Because of this third parameter, the whole shouldSave method is asynchronous.", "title": "shouldSave"}, {"location": "cozy-konnector-libs/synchronization/#shouldupdate", "text": "The shouldUpdate function acts exactly like shouldSave , except that it is used to determine if a document should be updated. By default, we make the choice to never update a document (except if it does not have synchronization data, see findLegacyDocument above). But some konnectors like Linxo related ones need to update existing documents. The default method is: async function shouldUpdate ( entry , existingDocument , cozy ) { // Update an existing document only if it does not have synchronization data const hasSyncData = !! existingDocument && !! existingDocument . metadata && !! existingDocument . metadata . sync return Promise . resolve ( ! hasSyncData ) } ```` ## Whole example As the way data are saved from `cozy-konnector-libs` differs based on data type , we let the saving mechanism to others functions or methods . For example , in existing codebase , bills are saved in a specific way , resulting in two documents in database . However , we could provide top - level functions or methods , like `synchronizeBills` or a more generic `synchronizeData` . Here is a whole and naive example of how `synchronizeBills` could be implemebted : ```js const synchronizeBills = async (cozy, entries, synchronizationStrategy) => { return await filteredEntries = await filterEntriesToSynchronize(cozy, entries, synchronizationStrategy) .then(filteredEntries => filteredEntries.map(entry => addSyncData(entry, synchronizationStrategy))) // existing saveBills method (with maybe some little changes) .saveBills(synchronizedDocuments) } Usage could be: synchronizeBills(cozy, entries, { findLegacyDocument: (entry, cozy) => { return cozy.files.statByPath(getEntryPath(entry)) }, getSyncData: (file) => ({ fileName: file.name }), idAttribute: 'uuid', konnector: 'myservice', shouldSave: (file) => { // For whatever reason we only save files created after 2010 return Promise.resolve(moment(file.creationDate).year().isAfter(2010)) }, shouldUpdate: (file, existingDocument) => { const hasBeenModified = moment(file.modificationDate).isAfter(existingDocument.metadata.sync.last_sync) return Promise.resolve(hasBeenModified) } }) Every synchronized document will contain: { \"metadata\" : { \"sync\" : { \"konnector\" : \"myservice\" , \"id\" : \"<entry_id>\" , \"last_sync\" : \"<now>\" , \"fileName\" : \"<fileName>\" } } }", "title": "shouldUpdate"}, {"location": "cozy-notifications/", "text": "cozy-notifications provides tools to send notifications (push or email) from a Cozy application or konnector. Installation \u00b6 yarn add cozy-notifications You will most likely also need a custom webpack config if building for node (for example in konnectors, since mjml and its dependents are not built for node-js). webpack.config.js const webpackMerge = require ( 'webpack-merge' ) const cozyNotificationsWebpackConfig = require ( 'cozy-notifications/dist/webpack/config' ) module . exports = webpackMerge ({ // initialConfig }, cozyNotificationsWebpackConfig ) The custom webpack config provided by cozy-notifications applies aliases and resolves for cozy-notifications to be used in a build targetting node. sendNotification \u00b6 The main entrypoint of this library is sendNotifification(cozyClient, notificationView) . Before being able to use it, we need to define a notification view class. Notification views \u00b6 Notification views are responsible for fetching the data necessary for the notification providing a template for the notification configuring the notification ( category , channels ) deciding if the notification should be sent class MyNotification { async buildData () { return { // data that will be used in the template } } getPushContent () { return 'push content' } getTitle () { return 'title' } getExtraAttributes () { return { data : { // data that will be sent in the notification payload for mobiles redirectLink : \"settings/#/subscription\" } } } } MyNotification . template = require ( './template.hbs' ) getExtraAttributes \u00b6 In getExtraAttributes , you can pass data that will be sent in the notification payload for mobiles. getExtraAttributes () { return { data : { // Standardized. When opening the notification, it will open settings app on subscription page. redirectLink : \"settings/#/subscription\" , // Standardized. When opening the notification, it will refresh the app. refresh : true , // You can also pass whatever you want. age : 42 } } } In getExtraAttributes , you can also pass a state (only needed if your notification is stateful ). getExtraAttributes () { return { // State to send the notification only 1 time per day. state : new Date (). toLocaleDateString ( 'fr-FR' , { day : '2-digit' , month : '2-digit' , year : 'numeric' }) } } preferredChannels \u00b6 We can define one which channels the user will receive the notification. MyNotification . preferredChannels = [ 'mobile' , 'mail' ] In this example, we first try to send the notification to a mobile, and if it fails to the email address of the user. Some things to know : the stack has a fallback by email mechanism. So preferredChannels = ['mobile', 'mail'] is equivalent to preferredChannels = ['mobile'] . the stack do not check the delivery of the email. So if you set preferredChannels = ['mail', 'mobile'] , it is very unlikely that a mobile notification will be sent. mobile \u00b6 The mobile channels consists of a push notification. Its title will be the result of the getTitle method and its content will be the result of getPushContent . mail \u00b6 Emails need more markup and thus will need the template class attribute. They are written in mjml , making it possible to write good looking emails in every major mail client. Templates \u00b6 Templates serve for the HTML content of emails. Templates used in notification views are based on handlebars for templating handlebars-layouts to be able to extend layouts mjml to build responsive emails This makes it simple to create emails that are based on built-in templates. For now cozy-notifications supports only the pre-built cozy-layout template. This template has the following parts to be filled: appName topLogo appURL footerHelp content Since appName , topLogo and appURL will mostly never change inside a particular application, it is advised to create a template extending cozy-layout in your application and then refer to it in each of your email templates. To provide the content for a particular part, use the following syntax: {{ #content \"part\" }} Content of the part {{ /content }} where you replace \"part\" with the name of the part you want to fill. Note: it is advised in an application to have your templates inside .hbs files for syntax coloring to work correctly. You must configure your bundler and/or test runner to require those files correctly. app-layout.hbs {{ #extend \"cozy-layout\" }} {{ #content \"logoUrl\" }} https://example.com/logo-url {{ /content }} {{ #content \"appName\" }} My App {{ /content }} {{ #content \"topLogo\" }} <mj-image width=\"129px\" src=\"https://downcloud.cozycloud.cc/upload/cozy-banks/email-assets/logo-cozy.png\" /> {{ /content }} {{ #content \"appURL\" }} https://my-app.com {{ /content }} {{ #content \"footerHelp\" }} <a css-class=\"footer__help\" href=\" {{ settingsUrl }} \"> {{ tGlobal @ root.lang 'settings' }} </a> <a css-class=\"footer__help\" href=\"https://support.cozy.io/\"> {{ tGlobal @ root.lang 'support' }} </a> {{ /content }} {{ /extend }} Now that we have provided generic parts, we can code a particular template. A sample template for a particular notification: my-notification.hbs {{ #extend \"app-layout\" }} {{ #content \"emailTitle\" }} A notification from My App ! {{ /content }} {{ #content \"emailSubtitle\" }} You should read this :) {{ /content }} {{ #content \"content\" }} <mj-section> {{ greeting name }} , Just to tell you that My App is awesome ! </mj-section> {{ /content }} {{ /extend }} We can now use our template for a notification view. import template from './my-notification.hbs' import appTemplate from './app-layout.hbs' import { NotificationView } from 'cozy-notifications' class MyNotificationView extends NotificationView { getPartials () { return { 'app-layout' : appTemplate } } } MyNotificationView . template = template Accessing different parts \u00b6 cozy-notifications is built with the vision that in the future, the whole email will not be sent directly to the stack, but only rendered parts will be sent; in other words, only appURL , topLogo , content etc\u2026 will be sent, instead of the whole content).

webpack.target.mobile.js Properties Plugins: Miscellaneous webpack.vars.js Introduction \u00b6 To build a Cozy application, cozy-scripts uses webpack under the hood, and this documentation is dedicated to all webpack configuration files. The webpack config is split to facilitate understanding. Having many unit files for the configuration allows to support specific application needs without \u2018ejecting\u2019 (removing cozy-scripts dependency and copy all webpack configurations and dependencies to the application repository). These files should be independent enough to be usable upon request as far as possible without conflicts. Config file types \u00b6 Bundle: A bundle regroups many unit configuration for a specific use case like the default React application. Environment: An environment config is in charge of providing variables and plugins specific to a compiling context (development or production for example). Target: For now we only have two targets, browser for the default web application and mobile for native mobile applications using Cordova (in progress). Bundles \u00b6 webpack.bundle.default.js \u00b6 This file is the default config bundle used for the application built from cozy-scripts . If you wish to customize a behavior, you can overload this configuration by creating a custom app.config.js in your application root directory: // app.config.js // using ES Modules import configs from 'cozy-scripts/config/webpack.bundle.default.js' import myConfig from './config/webpack.myconfig.js' // it's possible to add many custom configurations using this way, // the last will overwrite the previous in case of conflicts module . exports = [ configs , myConfig ] Unit Configs \u00b6 webpack.config.analyzer.js \u00b6 This file will only add the plugin webpack-bundle-analyzer to be run on with the --analyzer option. It will run a server (on port 8889 to not be in conflict with the webpack dev server) and open an interactive treemap visualization of the contents of all your bundles in your browser. webpack.config.base.js \u00b6 The default basic configuration of the application. Properties \u00b6 output to [name].js filename resolve: modules to ['node_modules', 'src'] extensions: .js , .json and .css Rules \u00b6 all .js (excluding node_modules , cozy-bar and cozy-client-js ) to be loaded using babel-loader (with cacheDirectory option for caching in node_modules/.cache/babel-loader ) all .css to be loaded using options: mini-css-extract-plugin extractor loader by default or style-loader for hot reloading css-loader with sourceMap postcss-loader to optimize css output code with sourceMap and autoprefixer plugin to { browsers: ['last 2 versions'] } A specific noParse property is enabled on /localforage/dist . Plugins \u00b6 postcss-assets-webpack-plugin (logs from this plugin are shown only in --debug mode) to load all .css files with: css-mqpacker (pack all CSS media query rules into one) postcss-discard-duplicates (remove duplicates) postcss-discard-empty (remove empty definitions) csswring only in production environment to minify and remove comments ( preservehacks enabled) webpack.config.chunks.js \u00b6 This configuration will use the optimization property with splitChunks in order to split the build into two chunks: - The main one, it can be app or intents - And the vendors chunk which will gather all stuff from node_modules Splitting chunks allow to decrease the size of the main chunk and optimize the build for caching (mainly the main chunk will change during development). webpack.config.cozy-ui.js \u00b6 This configuration will allow to load styles from cozy-ui . It adds a rule for all .styl files excluding node_modules and node_modules/cozy-ui/react to be loaded using: - mini-css-extract-plugin extractor loader by default or style-loader for hot reloading - css-loader with sourceMap - postcss-loader to optimize css output code with sourceMap and autoprefixer plugin to { browsers: ['last 2 versions'] } - stylus-loader using the custom stylus plugin from cozy-ui as option It also uses svg-sprite-loader/plugin to merge the built svg sprite from cozy-ui into the application\u2019s one webpack.config.cozy-ui.react.js \u00b6 This configuration is specific to react components usage from cozy-ui , since they currently need css-modules . This configuration file could be removed if this cozy-ui requirement disappear. It adds a rule for all .styl files from cozy-ui/react to be loaded using: - mini-css-extract-plugin extractor loader by default or style-loader for hot reloading - css-loader with modules , sourceMap and [local]--[hash:base64:5] as localIdentName - postcss-loader to optimize css output code with sourceMap and autoprefixer plugin to { browsers: ['last 2 versions'] } - stylus-loader using the custom stylus plugin from cozy-ui as option webpack.config.css-modules.js \u00b6 This configuration will allow to use css-modules with stylus files. To overload previous stylus loaders, it uses the following webpack-merge smartStrategy : { 'modules.loaders': 'replace' } . It adds a rule for all .styl files excluding node_modules and node_modules/cozy-ui/react to be loaded using: - mini-css-extract-plugin extractor loader by default or style-loader for hot reloading - css-loader with modules , sourceMap and [local]--[hash:base64:5] as localIdentName - postcss-loader to optimize css output code with sourceMap and autoprefixer plugin to { browsers: ['last 2 versions'] } - stylus-loader webpack.config.eslint.js \u00b6 A rule to preload all .js/.jsx files with eslint-loader (excluding node_modules ) extending babel-preset-cozy-app The emitWarning option is set to true for production environment or if hot reload is enabled to force emitting warning and to avoid errors breaking the build. webpack.config.intents.js \u00b6 This is a specific configuration file to develop application intents for the Cozy platform. It will: - add a webpack entry: the babel-polyfill import and the src/targets/intents/intents.jsx file - use html-webpack-plugin configured to use index.ejs HTML template from src/targets/intents/ with options: - title : name property of the package.json + intents - filename : intents/index.html , the output file - excludeChunks : to exclude chunk app - inject to false - minify with collapseWhitespace to true webpack.config.hash.js \u00b6 A custom webpack plugin usage to extract the hash from built files for reference. webpack.config.manifest.js \u00b6 A copy-webpack-plugin plugin usage to copy the manifest.webapp , README.md and LICENSE files to the output build folder. In the production environment, the manifest.webapp is transformed to include locales from the application src/locales folder (locales concerning manifest descriptions, permissions, names\u2026). It will look for the manifest property (if found) of the locale .json file. So the locales property of the manifest.webapp will be an object of language slugs as properties and each slug matching the related locales found. The langs array in the manifest will also be computed according to the languages found in src/locales . Except for production environment, the manifest.webapp is transformed using a custom function to change the slug property value to app (to keep using app.cozy.tools:8080 URL for different app development). webpack.config.pictures.js \u00b6 This configuration will handle all pictures files. It will add two rules: - all .svg files in sprites/ and icons/ folders will be loaded using svg-sprite-loader with output name to [name]_[hash] . This loader will merge all SVG content to one .svg file and replace their reference to the matching id . Only one .svg sprite file will be loaded by the ouput application. - all other .svg , .png , .gif , .jpg , .jpeg files will be loaded using file-loader with options: - path to img , the ouput folder - symbolId to [name].[hash].[ext] for production environment, [name].[ext] for other environments It also adds svg-sprite-loader/plugin as plugin to use it with the related loader. webpack.config.progress.js \u00b6 This config will just add a custom webpack plugin to display a progress bar when webpack building/watching. It internally uses the included webpack plugin webpack.ProgressPlugin . webpack.config.services.js \u00b6 This config will provide a separate config to build app services using Webpack multi-compiling . In this case, all services files ( .js files in the /src/targets/services/ folder) will be built using this separate webpack config. This config will: - use __mergeStrategy to drive the webpack-merge strategy : - disable smart merging - use the replace mode plugins , output , entry , optimization and module - define as webpack entry an array of all .js files contained in /src/target/services folder - use as output the /build/services folder with [name].js as filename - define the target as 'node' - disable devtool (boolean to false ) - define the global variable __TARGET__ to services using the plugin webpack.DefinePlugin This config will be used only if the webpack target is browser . webpack.config.react.js \u00b6 A config to load .jsx using for React components. It will: - resolve .jsx extensions - add a rule for .jsx files excluding node_modules (exception for node_modules/cozy-ui ) to be loaded using babel-loader (with cacheDirectory option for caching in node_modules/.cache/babel-loader ) webpack.config.vendors.js \u00b6 A copy-webpack-plugin plugin usage to copy all files from the vendors/assets/ folder to the output build folder. This config will also process the application icon and run svgo to optimize it if this is a SVG file.

There are many ways to contribute, and we appreciate all of them. Security Issues \u00b6 If you discover a security issue, please bring it to their attention right away! Please DO NOT file a public issue, instead send your report privately to security AT cozycloud DOT cc. Security reports are greatly appreciated and we will publicly thank you for it. We currently do not offer a paid security bounty program, but are not ruling it out in the future. Bug Reports \u00b6 While bugs are unfortunate, they\u2019re a reality in software. We can\u2019t fix what we don\u2019t know about, so please report liberally. If you\u2019re not sure if something is a bug or not, feel free to file a bug anyway. Opening an issue is as easy as following this link and filling out the fields. Here are some things you can write about your bug: A short summary What did you try, step by step? What did you expect? What did happen instead? What is the version of the Cozy Stack? You can also use the cozy-stack tools bug command to open the form to report issue prefilled with some useful system informations. Pull Requests \u00b6 Workflow \u00b6 Pull requests are the primary mechanism we use to change Cozy. GitHub itself has some great documentation on using the Pull Request feature. We use the \u2018fork and pull\u2019 model described there. Step 1: Fork \u00b6 Fork the project on GitHub and check out your copy locally: $ git clone https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack.git $ cd cozy-stack $ git remote add fork git://github.com/username/cozy-stack.git Step 2: Branch \u00b6 Create a branch and start hacking: $ git checkout -b my-branch -t origin/master Step 3: Code \u00b6 Well, I think you know how to do that. Just be sure to follow the coding guidelines from the Go community (gofmt, Effective Go , comment the code, etc.). We are using goimports to format code, and golangci-lint to detect code smells. $ make lint We are using eslint to lint JavaScript code. The linting rules are based on cozy-app $ make jslint Step 4: Test \u00b6 Don\u2019t forget to add tests and be sure they are green. You need CouchDB installed, with an account, and configuring the stack to use this account: $ export COZY_COUCHDB_URL = http://admin:password@localhost:5984 $ make unit-tests If you want to play with the modified cozy-stack (for example, testing it with a webapp), you can build it locally and start it with this command: $ make run Step 5: Commit \u00b6 Writing good commit messages is important. A commit message should describe what changed and why. Step 6: Rebase \u00b6 Use git pull --rebase , or git rebase (but not git merge ), to sync your work from time to time: $ git pull origin master --rebase Step 7: Push \u00b6 $ git push fork my-branch Go to https://github.com/username/cozy-stack and select your branch. Click the \u2018Pull Request\u2019 button and fill out the form. Pull requests are usually reviewed within a few days. If there are comments to address, apply your changes in a separate commit and push that to your branch. Code organization \u00b6 The codebase of cozy-stack contains several packages, and it is quite easy to have circular import issues in go. To limit the risk, we have split the packages in several directories with some rules for the imports. In short, a package in this list should import other packages that are on the same line or below: main and cmd are the top level packages web is where we have the routers and handlers for web requests worker is where we define the workers for our job system model is for high-level internal packages (in general one package is used for one doctype) client is a small number of packages used for writing clients for the stack pkg is the low-level packages (most of those packages are just a couple of structs and functions). Note that tests/testutils can be used safely in web and worker packages. In model , it can be used but it is recommended to use a fake package for the tests if it is the case. For example, model/oauth/client_test.go is declared as package oauth_test . External assets \u00b6 The cozy-stack serve some assets for the client application. In particular, cozy-client-js and cozy-bar assets are listed in assets/.externals . To update them, you can open a pull request for this file. When a maintainer will accept this pull request, he will also run make assets to transform them in go code (to make the repository go gettable). Useful commands \u00b6 There are some useful commands to know in order to develop with the go code of cozy-stack: cd cozy-stack make help # Show the commands that can be launched via make go build # Build the stack, also takes care of updating dependencies through gomodules go install # Installs the `cozy-stack` binary go test -v ./... # To launch the tests go run main.go serve # To start the API server godoc -http = :6060 # To start the documentation server # Open http://127.0.0.1:6060/pkg/github.com/cozy/cozy-stack/ Writing documentation \u00b6 Documentation improvements are very welcome. We try to keep a good documentation in the docs/ folder. But, you know, we are developers, we can forget to document important stuff that look obvious to us. And documentation can always be improved. Translations \u00b6 The Cozy Stack is translated on a platform called Transifex . This tutorial can help you to learn how to make your first steps here. If you have any question, don\u2019t hesitate to ask us! The translations are kept synchronized with transifex via their github integration.

When the Flagship app is installed on the user\u2019s phone, then they can share a document with the app to upload it in their Cozy. When doing so, the user will have to chose which cozy-app should receive the shared document from a list of elligible cozy-apps (i.e. cozy-drive, mespapiers, etc) To be elligible, a cozy-app has to declare what it can receive. This is done in its manifest.webapp file. The manifest \u00b6 The manifest.webapp file is used to declare the cozy-app\u2019s ability to receive files accept_from_flagship field \u00b6 First field to declare is accept_from_flagship . It should be set to true to make the cozy-app visible in the list of elligible cozy-apps Example: { \"name\" : \"Drive\" , \"name_prefix\" : \"Cozy\" , \"slug\" : \"drive\" , //... \"accept_from_flagship\" : true , //... } accept_documents_from_flagship field \u00b6 Declaring accept_from_flagship: true is not enough to be able to receive files from the Flagship app. The app should also declare which kind of files it can handle. The field accept_documents_from_flagship is an object containing all criteria that a file or a list of files should meet to be sharable with the cozy-app. accepted_mime_types criteria \u00b6 accepted_mime_types is used to declare each file type that can be handled by the cozy-app. This field should contain a list of all mime types that are supported by the cozy-app. Example of a cozy-app accepting PDF, and pictures: { //... \"accept_from_flagship\" : true , \"accept_documents_from_flagship\" : { \"accepted_mime_types\" : [ \"application/pdf\" , \"image/jpeg\" , \"image/png\" ], } } In order to accept all files types, it is possible to use '*/*' mime type Example of a cozy-app accepting all types of documents: { //... \"accept_from_flagship\" : true , \"accept_documents_from_flagship\" : { \"accepted_mime_types\" : [ \"*/*\" ], } } max_number_of_files criteria \u00b6 max_number_of_files is used to declare the maximum number of files that can be shared simultaneously with the cozy-app. Example of a cozy-app accepting only 1 document at a time: { //... \"accept_from_flagship\" : true , \"accept_documents_from_flagship\" : { \"max_number_of_files\" : 10 , } } Example of a cozy-app accepting up to 10 documents at a time: { //... \"accept_from_flagship\" : true , \"accept_documents_from_flagship\" : { \"max_number_of_files\" : 10 , } } Setting a limit is mandatory. The Flagship app doesn\u2019t support unlimited file number. max_size_per_file_in_MB criteria \u00b6 max_size_per_file_in_MB is used to declare the maximum size of files that can be handled by the cozy-app. The size limit is declared in MB. The size limit is per file. If multiple files are shared with the cozy-app, then each file size should be under that limit. Example of a cozy-app accepting documents up to 10MB: { //... \"accept_from_flagship\" : true , \"accept_documents_from_flagship\" : { \"max_size_per_file_in_MB\" : 10 , } } Setting a limit is mandatory.

It offers several endpoints to interact with your cozy-stack installation (E.g. interacting with instances, generating tokens, \u2026). Use the admin API only if you know what you are doing. The admin API provides a basic authentication, you must protect these endpoints as they are very powerful. The default port for the admin endpoints is 6060 . If you want to customize the parameters, please see the config file documentation page . Instance \u00b6 GET /instances \u00b6 Returns the list of all instances. By default, there is no pagination, but it is possible to add a page[limit] parameter in the query-string to paginate ( cf JSON-API pagination ). A page[skip] parameter in the query-string is also supported, but CouchDB may be slow on requests with a skip on large collections.

It accepts one parameter in the query-string: Fast to skip the files and folders consistency check as it can be quite long It will return a 200 OK , except if the instance is not found where the code will be 404 Not Found (a 5xx can also happen in case of server errors like CouchDB not available). The format of the response will be a JSON array of objects, each object representing an error. Possible error types \u00b6 invalid_rules \u00b6 This will be raised when the owner\u2019s sharing rules are invalid. The validation result will be returned in the error attribute. sharing_in_sharing \u00b6 This will be raised when the root of the sharing being checked is part of another sharing (i.e. one of its parent folders is shared). The parent sharing can be found either on the owner\u2019s instance or on one of its members\u2019 instance. The parent_sharing attribute will contain the parent sharing ID. missing_matching_docs_for_owner \u00b6 This will be raised if the shared files and folders associated with the sharing could not be fetched on the owner\u2019s instance. The request error will be returned in the error attribute. No further consistency checks will be run on this sharing. missing_sharing_for_member \u00b6 This will be raised when the associated io.cozy.sharing document cannot be found on a sharing member\u2019s instance. The request error will be returned in the error attribute. No further consistency checks will be run for this member. missing_files_rule_for_member \u00b6 This will be raised if a member\u2019s sharing doesn\u2019t have any sharing rule for io.cozy.files documents (while the owner\u2019s sharing has been determined to be of this type). The member\u2019s domain will be available in the member attribute. No further consistency checks will be run for this member. missing_matching_docs_for_member \u00b6 This will be raised if the shared files and folders associated with the sharing could not be fetched on a member\u2019s instance. The request error will be returned in the error attribute and the member\u2019s domain in the member attribute. No further consistency checks will be run for this member. disk_quota_exceeded \u00b6 This will be raised if a file is outdated or missing on an instance and its size is larger than the available space on this instance. If the file was created or modified in the last 5 minutes, the check is skipped as we expect the synchronization to happen later. The instance\u2019s domain will be available in the instance attribute. read_only_member \u00b6 This will be raised if a file or folder is outdated or missing on the owner\u2019s instance and the member being checked has only read-only access to the sharing. This is not really an error as this behavior is expected but since it can be confusing for users we log it for debugging purposes. The member\u2019s domain will be available in the member attribute. invalid_doc_rev \u00b6 This will be raised if a file or folder\u2019s revisions don\u2019t match on the owner\u2019s and member\u2019s instances while the member has write access to the sharing and the file size is not greater than the outdated instance\u2019s available disk space. The revisions generations can be the same too. If the document was modified in the last 5 minutes, the check is skipped as we expect the synchronization to happen later. The member\u2019s domain will be available in the member attribute, as well as the revision of the member document in memberRev and the complete owner document in ownerDoc . invalid_doc_name \u00b6 This will be raised if a file or folder\u2019s revisions match on the owner\u2019s and member\u2019s instances but their names don\u2019t. The member\u2019s domain will be available in the member attribute, as well as the name of the member document in memberName and the complete owner document in ownerDoc . invalid_doc_checksum \u00b6 This will be raised if a file\u2019s revisions match on the owner\u2019s and member\u2019s instances but their checksums don\u2019t. The member\u2019s domain will be available in the member attribute, as well as the checksum of the member file in memberChecksum and the complete owner document in ownerDoc . invalid_doc_parent \u00b6 This will be raised if a file or folder\u2019s parent directories don\u2019t match on the owner\u2019s and member\u2019s instances but their names don\u2019t. Since it is expected for the sharing root to not have different parents on each instance, the check does not apply to this document. The member\u2019s domain will be available in the member attribute, as well as the id of the member\u2019s parent directory in memberParent and the complete owner document in ownerDoc . missing_matching_doc_for_owner \u00b6 This will be raised if a file or directory is missing on the owner\u2019s instance while the member being check has write access to the sharing and the file size is not greater than the instance\u2019s available disk space. If the missing document was created or modified in the last 5 minutes, the check is skipped as we expect the synchronization to happen later. The member\u2019s domain will be available in the member attribute and the complete missing member document in memberDoc . missing_matching_doc_for_member \u00b6 This will be raised if a file or directory is missing on a member\u2019s instance while the file size is not greater than the instance\u2019s available disk space. If the missing document was created or modified in the last 5 minutes, the check is skipped as we expect the synchronization to happen later. The member\u2019s domain will be available in the member attribute and the complete missing owner document in ownerDoc . === Other error types include missing_trigger_on_active_sharing , trigger_on_inactive_sharing , not_enough_members , mail_not_sent , invalid_member_status , invalid_instance_for_member , missing_instance_for_member , missing_oauth_client , missing_access_token , invalid_number_of_credentials and missing_inbound_client_id . When checking for files and folders inconsistencies, sharings will be skipped when inactive, not initialized, read-only or not about io.cozy.files documents. Also, for each instance, only the sharings owned by said instance will be checked. Other sharings will be checked via their owner instance.

Field Description name the name to display on the home name_prefix the prefix to display with the name slug the default slug (it can be changed at install time) editor the editor\u2019s name to display on the cozy-bar of the app icon an icon for the home screenshots an array of path to the screenshots of the application category the category of the application short_description a short description of the application long_description a long description of the application source where the files of the app can be downloaded developer name and url for the developer locales translations of the name and description fields in other locales langs list of languages tags supported by the application version the current version number license the SPDX license identifier platforms a list of type , url values for derivate of the application for other devices intents a list of intents provided by this app (see here for more details) permissions a map of permissions needed by the app (see here for more details) notifications a map of notifications needed by the app (see here for more details) services a map of the services associated with the app (see below for more details) routes a map of routes for the app (see below for more details) mobile information about app\u2019s mobile version (see below for more details) accept_from_flagship boolean stating if the app is compatible with the Flagship app\u2019s \u201cOS Receive\u201d feature accept_documents_from_flagship when accept_from_flagship is true , defines what can be uploaded to the app (see here for more details) Routes \u00b6 A route make the mapping between the requested paths and the files. It can have an index, which is an HTML file, with a token injected on it that identify the application. This token must be used with the user cookies to use the services of the cozy-stack (except in the cases of a shared by link page). By default, a route can be only visited by the authenticated owner of the instance where the app is installed. But a route can be marked as public. In that case, anybody can visit the route. For example, an application can offer an administration interface on /admin , a public page on /public , and shared assets in /assets : { \"/admin\" : { \"folder\" : \"/\" , \"index\" : \"admin.html\" , \"public\" : false }, \"/public\" : { \"folder\" : \"/public\" , \"index\" : \"index.html\" , \"public\" : true }, \"/assets\" : { \"folder\" : \"/public-assets\" , \"public\" : true } } If an application has no routes in its manifest, the stack will create one route, this default one: { \"/\" : { \"folder\" : \"/\" , \"index\" : \"index.html\" , \"public\" : false } } Note : if you have a public route, it\u2019s probably better to put the app icon in it. So, the cozy-bar can display it for the users that go on the public part of the app. When the stack receives a request, it chooses the more specific route that matches, then it looks inside the associated folder to find the file, and send it. If the route is an exact match, the file will be the index, and it will be interpreted as a template, cf the list of variables . For example, with the previous routes, a request to /admin will use the file /admin.html as a template for the response. And a request to /assets/css/theme.css will use the file /public-assets/css/theme.css . Services \u00b6 Application may require background and offline process to analyse the user\u2019s data and emit some notification or warning even without the user being on the application. These part of the application are called services and can be declared as part of the application in its manifest. In contrast to konnectors , services have the same permissions as the web application and are not intended to collect outside informations but rather analyse the current set of collected information inside the cozy. However they share the same mechanisms as the konnectors to describe how and when they should be executed: via our trigger system. To define a service, first the code needs to be stored with the application content, as single (packaged) javascript files. In the manifest, declare the service and its parameters following this example: { \"services\" : { \"low-budget-notification\" : { \"type\" : \"node\" , \"file\" : \"/services/low-budget-notification.js\" , \"trigger\" : \"@cron 0 0 0 * * *\" } // ... } } The trigger field should follow the available triggers described in the jobs documentation . The file field should specify the service code run and the type field describe the code type (only \"node\" for now). If you need to know more about how to develop a service, please check the how-to documentation here . Note: it is possible to declare a service with no trigger. For example, this can be used when the service is programmatically called from another service. Available fields to the service \u00b6 During the service execution, the stack will give some environment variables to the service if you need to use them, available with process.env[FIELD] . Once again, it\u2019s the stack that gives those variables. So if you\u2019re developing a service and using a script to execute/test your service, you won\u2019t get those variables. - \"COZY_URL\" # Cozy URL - \"COZY_CREDENTIALS\" # The cozy app related token - \"COZY_LANGUAGE\" # Lang used for the service (ex: node) - \"COZY_LOCALE\" # Locale of the Cozy - \"COZY_TIME_LIMIT\" # Maximum execution time. After this, the job will be killed - \"COZY_JOB_ID\" # Job ID - \"COZY_COUCH_DOC\" # The CouchDB document which triggers the service Notifications \u00b6 For more informations on how te declare notifications in the manifest, see the notifications documentation . Here is an example: { \"notifications\" : { \"account-balance\" : { \"description\" : \"Alert the user when its account balance is negative\" , \"collapsible\" : true , // only interested in the last value of the notification \"multiple\" : true , // require sub-categories for each account \"stateful\" : false , \"default_priority\" : \"high\" , // high priority for this notification \"templates\" : { \"mail\" : \"file:./notifications/account-balance-mail.tpl\" } } } } Mobile \u00b6 Application may exist on mobile platforms. When it is the case, manifest can contain informations about the mobile apps. On a mobile device and on a native context, this attribute can be used to open the native mobile app from any another Cozy app. Following attributes should be set: - schema : the app\u2019s scheme that can be used to open it - id_playstore : the app\u2019s ID on the Google PlayStore - id_appstore : the app\u2019s ID on the Apple AppStore Example of mobile attribute for Cozy Pass: \"mobile\" : { \"schema\" : \"cozypass://\" , \"id_playstore\" : \"io.cozy.pass\" , \"id_appstore\" : \"cozy-pass/id1502262449\" } Resource caching \u00b6 To help caching of applications assets, we detect the presence of a unique identifier in the name of assets: a unique identifier is matched when the file base name contains a long hexadecimal subpart between \u2018.\u2019, of at least 10 characters. For instance app.badf00dbadf00d.js or icon.badbeefbadbeef.1.png . With such a unique identifier, the asset is considered immutable, and a long cache-control is added on corresponding HTTP responses. We recommend the use of bundling tools like webpack which offer the possibility to add such identifier on the building step of the application packages for all assets. Sources \u00b6 Here is the available sources, defined by the scheme of the source URL: registry:// : to install an application from the instance registries git:// , git+ssh:// , or git+https:// : to install an application from a git repository http:// or https:// : to install an application from an http server (via a tarball) file:// : to install an application from a local directory (for instance: file:///home/user/code/cozy-app ) The registry scheme expect the following elements: scheme: registry host: the name of the application path: /:channel the channel of the application (see the registry doc) Examples: registry://drive/stable , registry://drive/beta , and registry://drive/dev . For the git scheme, the fragment in the URL can be used to specify which branch to install. For the http and https schemes, the fragment can be used to give the expected sha256sum. POST /apps/:slug \u00b6 Install an application, ie download the files and put them in /apps/:slug in the virtual file system of the user, create an io.cozy.apps document, register the permissions, etc. This endpoint is asynchronous and returns a successful return as soon as the application installation has started, meaning we have successfully reached the manifest and started to fetch application data. To make this endpoint synchronous, use the header Accept: text/event-stream . This will make a eventsource stream sending the manifest and returning when the application has been installed or failed. Status codes \u00b6 202 Accepted, when the application installation has been accepted. 400 Bad-Request, when the manifest of the application could not be processed (for instance, it is not valid JSON). 404 Not Found, when the manifest or the source of the application is not reachable. 422 Unprocessable Entity, when the sent data is invalid (for example, the slug is invalid or the Source parameter is not a proper or supported url) Query-String \u00b6 Parameter Description Source URL from where the app can be downloaded (only for install) The Source parameter is optional: by default, the stable channel of the registry will be used. Request \u00b6 POST /apps/emails?Source=git://github.com/cozy/cozy-emails.git HTTP / 1.1 Accept : application/vnd.api+json Response \u00b6 HTTP / 1.1 202 Accepted Content-Type : application/vnd.api+json { \"data\" : [{ \"id\" : \"4cfbd8be-8968-11e6-9708-ef55b7c20863\" , \"type\" : \"io.cozy.apps\" , \"meta\" : { \"rev\" : \"1-7a1f918147df94580c92b47275e4604a\" }, \"attributes\" : { \"name\" : \"calendar\" , \"state\" : \"installing\" , \"slug\" : \"calendar\" , ... }, \"links\" : { \"self\" : \"/apps/calendar\" } }] } Note : it\u2019s possible to choose a git branch by passing it in the fragment like this: POST /apps/emails-dev?Source=git://github.com/cozy/cozy-emails.git%23dev HTTP / 1.1 PUT /apps/:slug \u00b6 Update an application with the specified slug name. This endpoint is asynchronous and returns a successful return as soon as the application installation has started, meaning we have successfully reached the manifest and started to fetch application data. To make this endpoint synchronous, use the header Accept: text/event-stream . This will make a eventsource stream sending the manifest and returning when the application has been updated or failed. Request \u00b6 PUT /apps/emails HTTP / 1.1 Accept : application/vnd.api+json Response \u00b6 HTTP / 1.1 202 Accepted Content-Type : application/vnd.api+json { \"data\" : [{ \"id\" : \"4cfbd8be-8968-11e6-9708-ef55b7c20863\" , \"type\" : \"io.cozy.apps\" , \"meta\" : { \"rev\" : \"1-7a1f918147df94580c92b47275e4604a\" }, \"attributes\" : { \"name\" : \"calendar\" , \"state\" : \"installing\" , \"slug\" : \"calendar\" , ... }, \"links\" : { \"self\" : \"/apps/calendar\" } }] } Status codes \u00b6 202 Accepted, when the application installation has been accepted. 400 Bad-Request, when the manifest of the application could not be processed (for instance, it is not valid JSON). 404 Not Found, when the application with the specified slug was not found or when the manifest or the source of the application is not reachable. 422 Unprocessable Entity, when the sent data is invalid (for example, the slug is invalid or the Source parameter is not a proper or supported url) Advanced usage \u00b6 Two optional query parameters are available for an app update: PermissionsAcked : (defaults to false ) Tells that the user accepted the permissions/ToS. It is useful if there are newer permissions or Terms Of Service and you want to be sure they were read or accepted. If set to false , the update will be blocked and the user will be told that a new app version is available. Note: PermissionsAcked can be skipped. If an instance is in a context configured with the parameter permissions_skip_verification sets to true , permissions verification will be ignored. Source (defaults to SourceURL installation parameter): Use a different source to update this app (e.g. to install a beta or dev app version) Examples: \u00b6 You have an email application on a stable channel, and you want to update it to a particular beta version: PUT /apps/emails?Source=registry://drive/1.0.0-beta HTTP / 1.1 Accept : application/vnd.api+json You want to attempt the email app update, but prevent it if new permissions were added PUT /apps/emails?PermissionsAcked=false HTTP / 1.1 Accept : application/vnd.api+json You can combine these parameters to use a precise app version and stay on another channel (when permissions are different): Install a version (e.g. 1.0.0 ) Ask an update to stable channel with PermissionsAcked to false Source will be stable , and your version remains 1.0.0 List installed applications \u00b6 GET /apps/ \u00b6 An application can be in one of these states: installed , the application is installed but still require some user interaction to accept its permissions ready , the user can use it installing , the installation is running and the app will soon be usable upgrading , a new version is being installed errored , the app is in an error state and can not be used.

The sub-domain is the slug used when installing the application ( calendar.cozy.example.org if it was installed via a POST on /apps/calendar). On the main domain ( cozy.example.org ), there will be the registration process, the login form, and it will redirect to home.cozy.example.org for logged-in users. Rationale \u00b6 The applications have different roles and permissions. An application is identified when talking to the stack via a token. The token has to be injected in the application, one way or another, and it have to be unaccessible from other apps. If the applications run on the same domain (for example https://cozy.example.org/apps/calendar ), it\u2019s nearly impossible to protect an application to take the token of another application. The security model of the web is based too heavily on Same Origin Policy for that. If the token is put in the html of the index.html page of an app, another app can use the fetch API to get the html page, parse its content and extract the token. We can think of other ways to inject the token (indexeddb, URL, cookies) but none will provide a better isolation. Maybe in a couple years, when the origin spec will be more advanced. So, if having the apps on the same origin is not possible, we have to put them on several origins. One interesting way to do that is using sandboxed iframes. An iframe with the sandbox attribute , and not allow-same-origin in it, will be assigned to a unique origin. The W3C warns: Potentially hostile files should not be served from the same server as the file containing the iframe element. Sandboxing hostile content is of minimal help if an attacker can convince the user to just visit the hostile content directly, rather than in the iframe. To limit the damage that can be caused by hostile HTML content, it should be served from a separate dedicated domain. Using a different domain ensures that scripts in the files are unable to attack the site, even if the user is tricked into visiting those pages directly, without the protection of the sandbox attribute. It may be possible to disable all html pages to have an html content-type, except the home, and having the home loading the apps in a sandboxed iframe, via the srcdoc attribute. But, it will mean that we will have to reinvent nearly everything. Even showing an image can no longer be done via an <img> tag, it will need to use post-message with the home. Such a solution is difficult to implement, is a very fragile (both for the apps developer than for security) and is an hell to debug when it breaks. Clearly, it\u2019s not an acceptable solution. Thus, the only choice is to have several origins, and sub-domains is the best way for that. Of course, it has the downside to be more complicated to deploy (DNS and TLS certificates). But, in the tradeoff between security and ease of administration, we definetively take the security first. Routes \u00b6 Should we be concerned that all the routes are on the same sub-domain? No, it\u2019s not an issue. There are two types of routes: the ones that are publics and those reserved to the authenticated user.

It can have an index, which is an HTML file, with a token injected on it that identify the application. This token must be used with the user cookies to use the services of the cozy-stack (except in the cases of a shared by link page). By default, a route can be only visited by the authenticated owner of the instance where the app is installed. But a route can be marked as public. In that case, anybody can visit the route. For example, an application can offer an administration interface on /admin , a public page on /public , and shared assets in /assets : { \"/admin\" : { \"folder\" : \"/\" , \"index\" : \"admin.html\" , \"public\" : false }, \"/public\" : { \"folder\" : \"/public\" , \"index\" : \"index.html\" , \"public\" : true }, \"/assets\" : { \"folder\" : \"/public-assets\" , \"public\" : true } } If an application has no routes in its manifest, the stack will create one route, this default one: { \"/\" : { \"folder\" : \"/\" , \"index\" : \"index.html\" , \"public\" : false } } Note : if you have a public route, it\u2019s probably better to put the app icon in it. So, the cozy-bar can display it for the users that go on the public part of the app. When the stack receives a request, it chooses the more specific route that matches, then it looks inside the associated folder to find the file, and send it. If the route is an exact match, the file will be the index, and it will be interpreted as a template, cf the list of variables .

An application is identified when talking to the stack via a token. The token has to be injected in the application, one way or another, and it have to be unaccessible from other apps. If the applications run on the same domain (for example https://cozy.example.org/apps/calendar ), it\u2019s nearly impossible to protect an application to take the token of another application. The security model of the web is based too heavily on Same Origin Policy for that. If the token is put in the html of the index.html page of an app, another app can use the fetch API to get the html page, parse its content and extract the token. We can think of other ways to inject the token (indexeddb, URL, cookies) but none will provide a better isolation. Maybe in a couple years, when the origin spec will be more advanced. So, if having the apps on the same origin is not possible, we have to put them on several origins. One interesting way to do that is using sandboxed iframes. An iframe with the sandbox attribute , and not allow-same-origin in it, will be assigned to a unique origin. The W3C warns: Potentially hostile files should not be served from the same server as the file containing the iframe element. Sandboxing hostile content is of minimal help if an attacker can convince the user to just visit the hostile content directly, rather than in the iframe. To limit the damage that can be caused by hostile HTML content, it should be served from a separate dedicated domain. Using a different domain ensures that scripts in the files are unable to attack the site, even if the user is tricked into visiting those pages directly, without the protection of the sandbox attribute. It may be possible to disable all html pages to have an html content-type, except the home, and having the home loading the apps in a sandboxed iframe, via the srcdoc attribute. But, it will mean that we will have to reinvent nearly everything. Even showing an image can no longer be done via an <img> tag, it will need to use post-message with the home. Such a solution is difficult to implement, is a very fragile (both for the apps developer than for security) and is an hell to debug when it breaks. Clearly, it\u2019s not an acceptable solution. Thus, the only choice is to have several origins, and sub-domains is the best way for that. Of course, it has the downside to be more complicated to deploy (DNS and TLS certificates).

When the cozy-stack receives a request, it checks that the request is authorized, and if yes, it processes it and answers it. What about OAuth2? \u00b6 OAuth2 is about delegating an access to resources on a server to another party. It is a framework, not a strictly defined protocol, for organizing the interactions between these 4 actors: the resource owner, the \u201cuser\u201d that can click on buttons the client, the website or application that would like to access the resources the authorization server, whose role is limited to give tokens but is central in OAuth2 interactions the resources server, the server that controls the resources. For cozy, both the authorization server and the resources server roles are played by the cozy-stack. The resource owner is the owner of a cozy instance. The client can be the cozy-desktop app, cozy-mobile, or many other applications. OAuth2, and its extensions, is a large world. At its core, there is 2 things: letting the client get a token issued by the authorization server, and using this token to access to the resources. OAuth2 describe 4 flows, called grant types, for the first part: Authorization code Implicit grant type Client credentials grant type Resource owner credentials grant type. On cozy, only the most typical one is used: authorization code. To start this flow, the client must have a client_id and client_secret . The Cozy stack implements the OAuth2 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol (an extension to OAuth2) to allow the clients to obtain them. OAuth2 has also 3 ways to use a token: in the query-string (even if the spec does not recommended it) in the POST body in the HTTP Authorization header. On cozy, only the HTTP header is supported. OAuth2 has a lot of assumptions. Let\u2019s see some of them and their consequences on Cozy: TLS is very important to secure the communications. in OAuth 1, there was a mechanism to sign the requests. But it was very difficult to get it right for the developers and was abandonned in OAuth2, in favor of using TLS. The Cozy instance are already accessible only in HTTPS, so there is nothing particular to do for that. There is a principle called TOFU, Trust On First Use. It said that if the user will give his permission for delegating access to its resources when the client will try to access them for the first time. Later, the client will be able to keep accessing them even if the user is no longer here to give his permissions. The client can\u2019t make the assumptions about when its tokens will work. The tokens have no meaning for him (like cookies in a browser), they are just something it got from the authorization server and can send with its request. The access token can expire, the user can revoke them, etc. OAuth 2.0 defines no cryptographic methods. But a developer that want to use it will have to put her hands in that. If you want to learn OAuth 2 in details, I recommend the OAuth 2 in Action book . The cozy stack as an authorization server \u00b6 In general, the cozy stack manages the authentication itself. This is what is described below. In some special cases, an integration with other softwares can be mandatory: this is possible to configure via delegated authentication . GET /auth/login \u00b6 Display a form with a password field to let the user authenticates herself to the cozy stack. This endpoint accepts a redirect parameter. If the user is already logged in, she will be redirected immediately. Else, the parameter will be transfered in the POST. This parameter can only contain a link to an application installed on the cozy (thus to a subdomain of the cozy instance). To protect against stealing authorization code with redirection, the fragment is always overriden: GET /auth/login?redirect=https://contacts.cozy.example.org/foo?bar#baz HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Cookie : ... Note : the redirect parameter should be URL-encoded. We haven\u2019t done that to make it clear what the path ( foo ), the query-string ( bar ), and the fragment ( baz ) are. HTTP / 1.1 302 Moved Temporarily Location : https://contacts.cozy.example.org/foo?bar# If the redirect parameter is invalid, the response will be 400 Bad Request . Same for other parameters, the redirection will happen only on success (even if OAuth2 says the authorization server can redirect on errors, it\u2019s very complicated to do it safely, and it is better to avoid this trap). POST /auth/login \u00b6 After the user has typed her passphrase and clicked on Login , a request is made to this endpoint. The redirect parameter is passed inside the body. If it is missing, the redirection will be made against the default target: the home application of this cozy instance. The redirect can be a full URL (like http://cozy-drive.example.org/#/folder ), or just a slug+path+hash (like drive/#/folder ). POST /auth/login HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded passphrase=p4ssw0rd&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fcontacts.cozy.example.org HTTP / 1.1 302 Moved Temporarily Set-Cookie : ... Location : https://contacts.cozy.example.org/foo When two-factor authentication (2FA) authentication is activated, this endpoint will not directly sent a redirection after this first passphrase step. In such case, a 200 OK response is sent along with a token value in the response (either in JSON if requested or directly in a new HTML form). Along with this token, a 2FA passcode is sent to the user via another transport (email for instance, depending on the user\u2019s preferences). Another request should be sent to /auth/twofactor with a valid pair (token, passcode) , ensuring that the user correctly entered its passphrase and received a fresh passcode by another mean.

If this parameter is present and set to true then the passphrase reset page won\u2019t display any button to go back to the login page. This is useful when this page is opened in a different context from the one in which the login page was opened (e.g. a browser vs a mobile native application). It is also possible to use from=settings parameter in the query-string, to go back to the settings app after the password has been reset. It is useful when the user wants to change their email address, as the process for changing this address requires the password.

POST /auth/register \u00b6 This route is used by OAuth2 clients to dynamically register them-selves. See OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol for the details. The client must send a JSON request, with at least: redirect_uris , an array of strings with the redirect URIs that the client will use in the authorization flow client_name , human-readable string name of the client to be presented to the end-user during authorization software_id , an identifier of the software used by the client (it should remain the same for all instances of the client software, whereas client_id varies between instances). It can also send the optional fields: client_kind (possible values: web, desktop, mobile, browser, etc.) client_uri , URL string of a web page providing information about the client logo_uri , to display an icon to the user in the authorization flow policy_uri , URL string that points to a human-readable privacy policy document that describes how the deployment organization collects, uses, retains, and discloses personal data software_version , a version identifier string for the client software. notification_platform , to activate notifications on the associated device, this field specify the platform used to send notifications: \"android\" : for Android devices with notifications via Firebase Cloud Messaging \"ios\" : for iOS devices with notifications via Firebase Cloud Messaging or APNS/2 \"huawei\" : for huawei devices with Push Kit notification_device_token , the token used to identify the mobile device for notifications.

When it is the case, the mobile/desktop will share its permissions with the webapp. It means several things: The mobile/desktop app will have the same permissions that the linked webapp. When a sharing by link is done in the mobile/desktop application, the linked webapp will be able to revoke it later, and vice versa. When the user accepts to give access to its Cozy to the mobile/desktop app, the linked webapp will be installed on the Cozy if it was not already the case. When the linked webapp is uninstalled, the right to access the Cozy for the mobile/desktop app will be revoked.

The user is shown what the client asks and has an accept button if she is OK with that. In case a limit has been set on the Cozy to the number of user-connected OAuth clients, and this limit has been reached already, the user will be presented a screen requesting to either remove some existing clients or, if enabled, increase the limit (e.g. by subscribing to a plan with a greater limit). Once the number of connected clients is brought back under the limit, the OAuth flow will resume and the permissions screen will be displayed. The parameters are: client_id , that identify the client redirect_uri , it has to be exactly the same as the one used in registration state , it\u2019s a protection against CSRF on the client (a random string generated by the client, that it can check when the user will be redirected with the authorization code. It can be used as a key in local storage for storing a state in a SPA). response_type , only code is supported scope , a space separated list of the permissions asked (like io.cozy.files:GET for read-only access to files). GET /auth/authorize?client_id=oauth-client-1&response_type=code&scope=io.cozy.files%3AGET%20io.cozy.contacts&state=Eh6ahshepei5Oojo&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.org%2F HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Note we warn the user that he is about to share his data with an application which only the callback URI is guaranteed. PKCE extension \u00b6 To improve security, the client can use the PKCE for OAuth 2 . In that case, two additional parameters must be send to GET /auth/authorize : code_challenge : the client creates a code_verifier , and then derive the code_challenge from it. code_challenge_method : it must be S256 (the only supported method). As a reminder, the relation between code_verifier and code_challenge is the following: code_challenge = BASE64URL-ENCODE(SHA256(code_verifier)) And, the code_verifier parameter must be sent to POST /auth/access_token (see below). POST /auth/authorize \u00b6 When the user accepts, her browser send a request to this endpoint: POST /auth/authorize HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded state=Eh6ahshepei5Oojo&client_id=oauth-client-1&scope=io.cozy.files%3AGET%20io.cozy.contacts&csrf_token=johw6Sho&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.org%2F Note : this endpoint is protected against CSRF attacks. The user is then redirected to the original client, with an access code in the URL: HTTP / 1.1 302 Moved Temporarily Location : https://client.org/?state=Eh6ahshepei5Oojo&code=Aih7ohth# GET /auth/authorize/sharing & POST /auth/authorize/sharing \u00b6 They are similar to /auth/authorize : they also make the user accept an OAuth thing, but it is specialized for sharing. They are a few differences, like the scope format (sharing rules, not permissions) and the redirection after the POST (with sharing=<sharing-id> in the query string). GET /auth/authorize/move & POST /auth/authorize/move \u00b6 They are similar to /auth/authorize , but instead of a page that lists the permissions, the user will be asked to type their password to confirm the action (even if they are already logged-in). If the 2FA is activated, the code will be asked too. This strong action seems adequate for authorizing to erase the data in the Cozy before importing data from another Cozy. Request GET \u00b6 GET /auth/authorize/move?state=8d560d60&client_id=oauth-client-2&redirect_uri=https://move.cozycloud.cc/callback/target HTTP / 1.1 Server : target.cozy.example Response GET \u00b6 HTTP / 1.1 200 OK Content-Type : application/html Request POST \u00b6 POST /auth/authorize/move HTTP / 1.1 Server : target.cozy.example Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded passphrase=hashed&state=8d560d60&client_id=oauth-client-2&csrf_token=johw6Sho&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmove.cozycloud.cc%2Fcallback%2Ftarget Response POST \u00b6 HTTP / 1.1 200 OK Content-Type : application/json { \"redirect\" : \"https://move.cozycloud.cc/callback/target?code=543d7eb8149c&used=123456&quota=5000000&state=8d560d60&vault=true\" } POST /auth/access_token \u00b6 Now, the client can check that the state is correct, and if it is the case, ask for an access_token . It can use this route with the code given above. This endpoint is also used to refresh the access token, by sending the refresh_token instead of the code . The parameters are: grant_type , with authorization_code or refresh_token as value code or refresh_token , depending on which grant type is used client_id client_secret Example: POST /auth/access_token HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded Accept : application/json grant_type=authorization_code&code=Aih7ohth&client_id=oauth-client-1&client_secret=Oung7oi5 HTTP / 1.1 200 OK Content-Type : application/json { \"access_token\" : \"ooch1Yei\" , \"token_type\" : \"bearer\" , \"refresh_token\" : \"ui0Ohch8\" , \"scope\" : \"io.cozy.files:GET io.cozy.contacts\" } POST /auth/session_code \u00b6 This endpoint can be used by the flagship application in order to create a session code: this code can be added to the URL of a cozy application (in the query string, as session_code ) to create a session. The flagship can create this code with its access token, and then use it in a webview to avoid the reauthentication of the user. It can also create the code with the hashed passphrase (and 2FA if needed) to create a session for the authorize page. Note that the difference between a session_code and a magic_code (code in a magic link sent by email) is the behavior when two-factor authentication is enabled. The session_code will open the session while the magic_code will require the password for that.

The access tokens are formatted as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) , like this: Claim Fullname What it identifies aud Audience Identify the recipient where the token can be used (like access ) iss Issuer Identify the Cozy instance (its domain in fact) iat Issued At Identify when the token was issued (Unix timestamp) sub Subject Identify the client that can use the token scope Scope Identify the scope of actions that the client can accomplish The scope is used for permissions . Other tokens can be JWT with a similar formalism, or be a simple random value (when we want to have a clear revocation process). What happens when the user has lost her passphrase? She can reset it from the command-line, like this: $ cozy-stack instances reset-passphrase cozy.example.org ek0Jah1R A new password is generated and print in the console. Is two-factor authentication (2FA) possible? Yes, it\u2019s possible. Via the cozy-settings application, the two-factor authentication can be activated. Here is how it works in more details: On each connection, when the 2FA is activated, the user is asked for its passphrase first. When entering correct passphrase, the user is then asked for: a TOTP (Timebased One-Time password, RFC 6238) derived from a secret associated with the instance. a short term timestamped MAC with the same validity time-range and also derived from the same secret. The TOTP is valid for a time range of about 5 minutes. When sending a correct and still-valid pair (passcode, token) , the user is granted with authentication cookie. The passcode can be sent to the instance\u2019s owner via email \u2014 more transport shall be added later. POST /auth/tokens/konnectors/:slug \u00b6 This endpoint can be used by the flagship application in order to create a token for the konnector with the given slug. This token can then be used by the client-side konnector to make requests to cozy-stack. The flagship app will need to use its own access token to request the konnector token.

The steps looks similar (like obtaining a token), but when going in the details, it doesn\u2019t match. How to register the application? \u00b6 The application is registered at install. See app management for details. How to get a token? \u00b6 When a user access an application, she first loads the HTML page. Inside this page, a token specific to this app is injected (only for private routes), via a templating method. We have prefered our custom solution to the implicit grant type of OAuth2 for 2 reasons: It has a better User Experience. The implicit grant type works with 2 redirections (the application to the stack, and then the stack to the application), and the first one needs JS to detect if the token is present or not in the fragment hash. It has a strong impact on the time to load the application. The implicit grant type of OAuth2 has a severe drawback on security: the token appears in the URL and is shown by the browser. It can also be leaked with the HTTP Referer header. The token will be given only for the authenticated user. For nested subdomains (like calendar.joe.example.net ), the session cookie from the stack is enough (it is for .joe.example.net ). But for flat subdomains (like joe-calendar.example.net ), it\u2019s more complicated. On the first try of the user, she will be redirected to the stack. As she is already logged-in, she will be redirected to the app with a session code (else she can login). This session code can be exchanged to a session cookie. A redirection will still happen to remove the code from the URL (it helps to avoid the code being saved in the browser history). For security reasons, the session code have the following properties: It can only be used once. It is tied to an application ( calendar in our example). It has a very short time span of validity (1 minute). How to use a token? \u00b6 The token can be sent to the cozy-stack as a Bearer token in the Authorization header, like this: GET /data/io.cozy.events/6494e0ac-dfcb-11e5-88c1-472e84a9cbee HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Authorization : Bearer application-token If the user is authenticated, her cookies will be sent automatically. The cookies are needed for a token to be valid. How to refresh a token? \u00b6 The token is valid only for 24 hours. If the application is opened for more than that, it will need to get a new token. But most applications won\u2019t be kept open for so long and it\u2019s okay if they don\u2019t try to refresh tokens. At worst, the user just had to reload its page and it will work again. The app can know it\u2019s time to get a new token when the stack starts sending 401 Unauthorized responses. In that case, it can fetches the same html page that it was loaded initially, parses it and extracts the new token. Third-party websites \u00b6 How to register the application? \u00b6 If a third-party websites would like to access a cozy, it had to register first. For example, a big company can have data about a user and may want to offer her a way to get her data back in her cozy. When the user is connected on the website of this company, she can give her cozy address. The website will then register on this cozy, using the OAuth2 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol, as explained above . How to get a token? \u00b6 To get an access token, it\u2019s enough to follow the authorization code flow of OAuth2: sending the user to the cozy, on the authorize page if the user approves, she is then redirected back to the client the client gets the access code and can exchange it to an access token. How to use a token? \u00b6 The access token can be sent as a bearer token, in the Authorization header of HTTP: GET /data/io.cozy.contacts/6494e0ac-dfcb-11e5-88c1-472e84a9cbee HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.org Accept : application/json Authorization : Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWV9.TJVA95OrM7E2cBab30RMHrHDcEfxjoYZgeFONFh7HgQ How to refresh a token? \u00b6 The access token will be valid only for 24 hours. After that, a new access token must be asked. To do that, just follow the refresh token flow, as explained above . Devices and browser extensions \u00b6 For devices and browser extensions, it is nearly the same than for third-party websites. The main difficulty is the redirect_uri. In OAuth2, the access code is given to the client by redirecting the user to an URL controlled by the client. But devices and browser extensions don\u2019t have an obvious URL for that. The IETF has published an RFC called OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps . Native apps on desktop \u00b6 A desktop native application can start an embedded webserver on localhost. The redirect_uri will be something like http://127.0.0.1:19856/callback . Native apps on mobile \u00b6 On mobile, the native apps can often register a custom URI scheme, like com.example.oauthclient:/ . Just be sure that no other app has registered itself with the same URI. Chrome extensions \u00b6 Chrome extensions can use URL like https://<extension-id>.chromiumapp.org/<anything-here> for their usage. See https://developer.chrome.com/apps/app_identity#non for more details. It has also a method to simplify the creation of such an URL: chrome.identity.getRedirectURL . Firefox extensions \u00b6 It is possible to use an out of band URN: urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob:auto . The token is then extracted from the title of the page. See this addon for google oauth2 as an example. Security considerations \u00b6 The master password, the password known by the user, is derived on the clients to give two keys. The first key is used to login on the stack, the second key is used to do client-side encryption. The derivation for the login password is currently done with the PBKDF2 algorithm (with SHA256), but we have anticipated the possibility of changing to another algorithm if desirable. The derived password is stored on the server in a secure fashion, with a password hashing function. The hashing function and its parameter are stored with the hash, in order to make it possible to change the algorithm and/or the parameters later if we had any suspicion that it became too weak. The initial algorithm is scrypt . The access code is valid only once, and will expire after 5 minutes Dynamically registered applications won\u2019t have access to all possible scopes. For example, an application that has been dynamically registered can\u2019t ask the cozy owner to give it the right to install other applications. This limitation should improve security, as avoiding too powerful scopes to be used with unknown applications. The cozy stack will apply rate limiting to avoid brute-force attacks. The cozy stack offers CORS for most of its services. But it\u2019s disabled for /auth (it doesn\u2019t make sense here) and for the client-side applications (to avoid leaking their tokens). The client should really use HTTPS for its redirect_uri parameter, but it\u2019s allowed to use HTTP for localhost, as in the native desktop app example. OAuth2 says that the state parameter is optional in the authorization code flow. But it is mandatory to use it with Cozy.

It is a framework, not a strictly defined protocol, for organizing the interactions between these 4 actors: the resource owner, the \u201cuser\u201d that can click on buttons the client, the website or application that would like to access the resources the authorization server, whose role is limited to give tokens but is central in OAuth2 interactions the resources server, the server that controls the resources. For cozy, both the authorization server and the resources server roles are played by the cozy-stack. The resource owner is the owner of a cozy instance. The client can be the cozy-desktop app, cozy-mobile, or many other applications. OAuth2, and its extensions, is a large world. At its core, there is 2 things: letting the client get a token issued by the authorization server, and using this token to access to the resources. OAuth2 describe 4 flows, called grant types, for the first part: Authorization code Implicit grant type Client credentials grant type Resource owner credentials grant type. On cozy, only the most typical one is used: authorization code. To start this flow, the client must have a client_id and client_secret . The Cozy stack implements the OAuth2 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol (an extension to OAuth2) to allow the clients to obtain them. OAuth2 has also 3 ways to use a token: in the query-string (even if the spec does not recommended it) in the POST body in the HTTP Authorization header. On cozy, only the HTTP header is supported. OAuth2 has a lot of assumptions. Let\u2019s see some of them and their consequences on Cozy: TLS is very important to secure the communications. in OAuth 1, there was a mechanism to sign the requests. But it was very difficult to get it right for the developers and was abandonned in OAuth2, in favor of using TLS. The Cozy instance are already accessible only in HTTPS, so there is nothing particular to do for that. There is a principle called TOFU, Trust On First Use. It said that if the user will give his permission for delegating access to its resources when the client will try to access them for the first time. Later, the client will be able to keep accessing them even if the user is no longer here to give his permissions. The client can\u2019t make the assumptions about when its tokens will work. The tokens have no meaning for him (like cookies in a browser), they are just something it got from the authorization server and can send with its request. The access token can expire, the user can revoke them, etc. OAuth 2.0 defines no cryptographic methods. But a developer that want to use it will have to put her hands in that.

The implicit grant type works with 2 redirections (the application to the stack, and then the stack to the application), and the first one needs JS to detect if the token is present or not in the fragment hash. It has a strong impact on the time to load the application. The implicit grant type of OAuth2 has a severe drawback on security: the token appears in the URL and is shown by the browser. It can also be leaked with the HTTP Referer header. The token will be given only for the authenticated user.

The first key is used to login on the stack, the second key is used to do client-side encryption. The derivation for the login password is currently done with the PBKDF2 algorithm (with SHA256), but we have anticipated the possibility of changing to another algorithm if desirable. The derived password is stored on the server in a secure fashion, with a password hashing function. The hashing function and its parameter are stored with the hash, in order to make it possible to change the algorithm and/or the parameters later if we had any suspicion that it became too weak. The initial algorithm is scrypt . The access code is valid only once, and will expire after 5 minutes Dynamically registered applications won\u2019t have access to all possible scopes. For example, an application that has been dynamically registered can\u2019t ask the cozy owner to give it the right to install other applications. This limitation should improve security, as avoiding too powerful scopes to be used with unknown applications. The cozy stack will apply rate limiting to avoid brute-force attacks. The cozy stack offers CORS for most of its services. But it\u2019s disabled for /auth (it doesn\u2019t make sense here) and for the client-side applications (to avoid leaking their tokens). The client should really use HTTPS for its redirect_uri parameter, but it\u2019s allowed to use HTTP for localhost, as in the native desktop app example. OAuth2 says that the state parameter is optional in the authorization code flow. But it is mandatory to use it with Cozy.

The author of the unofficial Bitwarden-ruby server did some reverse engineering and wrote a short API documentation . Setup \u00b6 The signup is disabled, there is one account per Cozy instance, with the email me@<domain> . When the user chooses his/her password (onboarding), an encryption key is also generated to keep safe the secrets in the bitwarden vault. A cozy organization is also created: it will be used to share some passwords with the stack, to be used for the konnectors. The bitwarden clients can connect to the cozy-stack APIs by setting their URL to https://<instance>/bitwarden . Routes for accounts and connect \u00b6 GET /bitwarden/api/config \u00b6 Bitwarden clients require this route, even if the information could be guessed without it in Cozy case.

This new file should be named cozy.yaml , cozy.yml , or cozy.json depending on the format of your chosing, and should be present in one of these directories (ordered by priority): ./.cozy $HOME/.cozy /etc/cozy The path of the configuration file can also be define from an absolute path given by the --config (or -c ) flag of the cozy-stack command . Note that is is possible to have an additional configuration file, with the .local suffix. For example, it can be used to have /etc/cozy/cozy.yml managed by a package manager, and /etc/cozy/cozy.yml.local for things that a user can customize. Templating and Environment Variables \u00b6 It is possible to pass environnment variable to this configuration using the template language of golang , delimited by {{ and }} . The environment variables are available in the .Env variable. For instance the text {{.Env.COUCHDB_PASSPHRASE }} will be replaced by the value of the COUCHDB_PASSPHRASE environment variable. The template is evaluated at startup of the stack. Values and Example \u00b6 To see the detail of the available parameters available, you can see an example of configuration in the cozy.example.yaml file at the root of this repository. This file contains all the parameters and fields that can be used to configure the stack with some example values. Some fields can be overriden by the flags of the cozy-stack serve command . Stack endpoints \u00b6 By default, cozy-stack use plain-text & local socket for client ( localhost:8080 ) and admin ( localhost:6060 ) communications. If you want to control a remote stack or using TLS to secure communications, you can configure your cozy-stack client with the following CLI arguments or environment variables. Argument Env variable Default value Usage --host / --admin-host COZY_HOST / COZY_ADMIN_HOST localhost [http[s]://]<fqdn>[:<port>] --port / --admin-port COZY_PORT / COZY_ADMIN_PORT 8080 / 6060 COZY_HOST_TIMEOUT / COZY_ADMIN_TIMOUT 15s HTTP timeout to use Must be a valid golang duration like 10s or 1m COZY_HOST_VALIDATE / COZY_ADMIN_VALIDATE true Enable HTTPS certificate validation Can also be set via host URL query part, like https://localhost:6060?validate=false COZY_HOST_CA / COZY_ADMIN_CA none CA file to use for HTTPS certificate validation Can also be set via host URL query part, like https://localhost:6060?ca=<ca> COZY_HOST_CERT / COZY_ADMIN_CERT none Client certificate to use Can also be set via host URL query part, like https://localhost:6060?cert=<cert> COZY_HOST_KEY / COZY_ADMIN_KEY none Client certificate to use Can also be set via host URL query part, like https://localhost:6060?key=<key> COZY_HOST_FINGERPRINT / COZY_ADMIN_FINGERPRINT none Hex-encoded SHA-256 key pinning to use Can also be set via host URL query part, like https://localhost:6060?fp=<fp> You can get the fingerprint of a given certificate with openssl x509 -in <certificat.crt> -pubkey \\| openssl pkey -pubin -outform der \\| openssl dgst -sha256 -hex or directly from a private key with openssl pkey -in <key.pem> -pubout -outform der \\| openssl dgst -sha256 -hex Administration secret \u00b6 To access to the administration API (the /admin/* routes), a secret passphrase should be stored in a cozy-admin-passphrase . This file should be in one of the configuration directories, along with the main config file. The passphrase is stored in a salted-hashed representation using scrypt. To generate this file, you can use the cozy-stack config passwd [filepath] command. This command will ask you for a passphrase and will create the cozy-admin-passphrase at the specified path. You can use the COZY_ADMIN_PASSPHRASE (or COZY_ADMIN_PASSWORD ) env variable if you do not want to type the passphrase each time you call cozy-stack . Example \u00b6 $ mkdir ~/.cozy && cozy-stack config passwd ~/.cozy/cozy-admin-passphrase Hashed passphrase will be writtent in ~/.cozy/cozy-admin-passphrase Passphrase: Confirmation: $ cat ~/.cozy/cozy-admin-passphrase scrypt $16384$8$1$936 bd62faf633b5f946f653c21161a9b $4 e0d11dfa5fc1676ed329938b11a6584d30e603e0d06b8a63a99e8cec392d682 Temporary files \u00b6 The stack can use some temporary directories and files (execution of Image Magick, konnectors and services for example). And they can take several GB for the case of importing a Cozy. If needed, it is possible to configure the directory where they will be created via the TMPDIR environment variable. Multiple CouchDB clusters \u00b6 With a large number of instances, a single CouchDB cluster may not be enough. Most cozy-stack administrators can ignore this section, but if you need this advanced settings, let\u2019s see how to configure it. We start with a classical configuration for a single cluster: couchdb : url : http://cluster1:5984/ The first step is to add the new cluster, but still forces the creation on the first cluster for the moment: couchdb : url : http://cluster1:5984/ clusters : - url : http://cluster1:5984/ instance_creation : true - url : http://cluster2:5984/ instance_creation : false Then, we can restart the cozy-stack and everything will work the same, except that the stack now knows how to use an instance on the new cluster. We can now use the second cluster for instance creations instead of the first: couchdb : url : http://cluster1:5984/ clusters : - url : http://cluster1:5984/ instance_creation : false - url : http://cluster2:5984/ instance_creation : true Notes: if several CouchDB clusters are configured to accept creations, a new instance will be put in a CouchDB cluster taken randomly each instance document will keep the list index of the CouchDB cluster used for its databases, so don\u2019t remove a cluster in the middle of the list! OnlyOffice \u00b6 An integration between Cozy and OnlyOffice has been made. It allows the collaborative edition of office documents in the browser. There are some pre-requistes. OnlyOffice Docs must be installed on a server ( The community edition is free but limited to 20 connections and doesn\u2019t have the mobile mode). It can be the same server as the stack, but it is tricky as the default port of the stack and of the spellchecker of OnlyOffice is 8080 for both. The stack and the OnlyOffice components must be able to make HTTP requests to each other. And, for security, these requests can be signed via some shared secrets, called inbox and outbox secrets in OnlyOffice configuration. In the local.json configuration file of OnlyOffice, we need: services.CoAuthoring.token.enable.browser : true services.CoAuthoring.token.enable.request.inbox : true services.CoAuthoring.token.enable.request.outbox : true services.CoAuthoring.secret.inbox : a random secret services.CoAuthoring.secret.outbox : another random secret In the cozy configuration file, we need to add a section with: office : default : onlyoffice_url : https://onlyoffice.example.net/ onlyoffice_inbox_secret : inbox_secret onlyoffice_outbox_secret : outbox_secret Don\u2019t forget to restart all the services after having made the changes to the configuration files. And you should be able to edit office documents in your browser via the Drive application. Customizing a context \u00b6 Intro \u00b6 In the config file of cozy-stack, it\u2019s possible to declare some contexts, that are a way to regroup some cozy instances to give similar configuration. For example, it is possible to give a default_redirection that will be used when the user logs into their cozy. You can find more example in the example config file. Assets \u00b6 The visual appearance of a cozy instance can be customized via some assets (CSS, JS, images). These assets can be inserted from the command-line with the cozy-stack assets add command. Here are a small list of assets that you may want to customize: /styles/theme.css : a CSS file where you can override the colors and put other CSS rules /favicon.ico : the old-school favicon /icon.svg : the favicon in SVG format /icon-192.png and /icon-512.png : the two variants of the favicon /apple-touch-icon.png : the same but for Apple /images/default-avatar.png : the image to use as the default avatar. /images/default-wallpaper.jpg : the image to use as the default wallpapper on the home. /images/icon-cozy-home.svg : the home icon used and displayed by the cozy-bar. /images/icon-cozy-home-inverted.svg : the home icon used and displayed by the cozy-bar when using the theme inverted.", "title": "Configuration file"}, {"location": "cozy-stack/config/#configuration", "text": "", "title": "Configuration"}, {"location": "cozy-stack/config/#main-configuration-file", "text": "You can configure your cozy-stack using a configuration file.

For false , a more heavy solution is required: a partial index . Index selection \u00b6 CouchDB may accept or refuse to use a mango index for a query, with obsure reasons. In general, you can follow these two rules of thumb: An index on the fields foo, bar, baz can be used only to fetch documents where foo , bar , and baz exist. It means that a query that filters only on the value on foo won\u2019t use the mango index, because it can miss a document where foo has the expected value but without bar or baz . If you know that all the documents that you want have the bar and baz fields, you can just add two filters $exists: true (one for bar , the other for baz ). You should use exactly the same sequence of fields for creating the index and the sort operator of the query. If you have an index on os, browser, ip for the io.cozy.sessions.logins , and you want to have all the documents for a login from windows , sorted by browser , you can use the index, but you should use os, browser, ip for the sort (or at least os, browser , even if it is seems to weird to sort on os when all the sorted documents will have the same value, windows ). Please note that using use_index on a request, the results will be sorted by default according to this rule. So, you can omit the sort operator on the query (except if you want the descending order). Warnings for slow requests \u00b6 When requesting a mango index, CouchDB can use an index. But there are also cases where no index can be used, or where the index is not optimal. Let\u2019s see the different scenarios: CouchDB doesn\u2019t use an index, it will respond with a warning, and cozy-stack will transform this warning in an error, as developers should really avoid this issue CouchDB can use an index for the selector but not for the sort, it will respond with an error, and the cozy-stack will just forward the error CouchDB can use an index, but will still look at much more documents in the index that what will be in the response (it happens with $or and $in operators, which should be avoided), CouchDB 3+ will send a warning and the cozy-stack will forward the documents and the warning to the client. Comparison of strings \u00b6 Comparison of strings is done using ICU which implements the Unicode Collation Algorithm, giving a dictionary sorting of keys. This can give surprising results if you were expecting ASCII ordering. Note that: All symbols sort before numbers and letters (even the \u201chigh\u201d symbols like tilde, 0x7e ) Differing sequences of letters are compared without regard to case, so a < aa but also A < aa and a < AA Identical sequences of letters are compared with regard to case, with lowercase before uppercase, so a < A . Old revisions \u00b6 CouchDB keeps for each document a list of its revision (or more exactly a tree with replication and conflicts). It\u2019s possible to ask the list of the old revisions of a document with GET /db/{docid}?revs_info=true . It works only if the document has not been deleted. For a deleted document, a trick is to query the changes feed to know the last revision of the document, and to recreate the document from this revision. With an old revision, it\u2019s possible to get the content of the document at this revision with GET /db/{docid}?rev={rev} if the database was not compacted. On CouchDB 2.x, compacts happen automatically on all databases from times to times. A purge operation consists to remove the tombstone for the deleted documents. It is a manual operation, triggered by a POST /db/_purge . Conflicts \u00b6 It is possible to create a conflict on CouchDB like it does for the replication by using new_edits: false , but it is not well documented to say the least. The more accurate description was in the old wiki, that no longer exists . Here is a copy of what it said: The replicator uses a special mode of _bulk_docs. The documents it writes to the destination database already have revision IDs that need to be preserved for the two databases to be in sync (otherwise it would not be possible to tell that the two represent the same revision.) To prevent the database from assigning them new revision IDs, a \u201cnew_edits\u201d:false property is added to the JSON request body. Note that this changes the interpretation of the _rev parameter in each document: rather than being the parent revision ID to be matched against, it\u2019s the existing revision ID that will be saved as-is into the database. And since it\u2019s important to retain revision history when adding to the database, each document body in this mode should have a _revisions property that lists its revision history; the format of this property is described on the HTTP document API. For example: curl -X POST -d '{\"new_edits\":false,\"docs\":[{\"_id\":\"person\",\"_rev\":\"2-3595405\",\"_revisions\":{\"start\":2,\"ids\":[\"3595405\",\"877727288\"]},\"name\":\"jim\"}]}' \"$OTHER_DB/_bulk_docs\" This command will replicate one of the revisions created above, into a separate database OTHER_DB . It will have the same revision ID as in DB , 2-3595405 , and it will be known to have a parent revision with ID 1-877727288 . (Even though OTHER_DB will not have the body of that revision, the history will help it detect conflicts in future replications.) As with _all_or_nothing, this mode can create conflicts; in fact, this is where the conflicts created by replication come from. In short, it\u2019s a PUT /doc/{id}?new_edits=false with _rev the new revision of the document, and _revisions the parents of this revision in the revisions tree of this document. Conflict example \u00b6 Here is an example of a CouchDB conflict. Let\u2019s assume the following document with the revision history [1-abc, 2-def] saved in database: { \"_id\": foo, \"_rev\": 2-def, \"bar\": \"tender\", \"_revisions\": { \"ids\": [ \"def\", \"abc\" ] } } The _revisions block is returned when passing revs=true to the query and gives all the revision ids, which the revision part after the dash. For instance, in 2-def , 2 is called the \u201cgeneration\u201d and def the \u201cid\u201d. We update the document with a POST /bulk_docs query, with the following content: { \"docs\": [ { \"_id\": \"foo\", \"_rev\": \"3-ghi\", \"_revisions\": { \"start\": 3, \"ids\": [\"ghi\", \"xyz\", \"abc\"] } , \"bar\": \"racuda\" } ], \"new_edits\": false } This produces a conflict bewteen 2-def and 2-xyz : the former was first saved in database, but we forced the latter to be a new child of 1-abc . Hence, this document will have two revisions branches: 1-abc, 2-def and 1-abc, 2-xyz, 3-ghi . Sharing \u00b6 In the sharing protocol , we implement this behaviour as we follow the CouchDB replication model. However, we prevent CouchDB conflicts for files and directories: see this explanation Design docs in _all_docs \u00b6 When querying GET /{db}/_all_docs , the response include the design docs.

The more accurate description was in the old wiki, that no longer exists . Here is a copy of what it said: The replicator uses a special mode of _bulk_docs. The documents it writes to the destination database already have revision IDs that need to be preserved for the two databases to be in sync (otherwise it would not be possible to tell that the two represent the same revision.) To prevent the database from assigning them new revision IDs, a \u201cnew_edits\u201d:false property is added to the JSON request body. Note that this changes the interpretation of the _rev parameter in each document: rather than being the parent revision ID to be matched against, it\u2019s the existing revision ID that will be saved as-is into the database. And since it\u2019s important to retain revision history when adding to the database, each document body in this mode should have a _revisions property that lists its revision history; the format of this property is described on the HTTP document API. For example: curl -X POST -d '{\"new_edits\":false,\"docs\":[{\"_id\":\"person\",\"_rev\":\"2-3595405\",\"_revisions\":{\"start\":2,\"ids\":[\"3595405\",\"877727288\"]},\"name\":\"jim\"}]}' \"$OTHER_DB/_bulk_docs\" This command will replicate one of the revisions created above, into a separate database OTHER_DB . It will have the same revision ID as in DB , 2-3595405 , and it will be known to have a parent revision with ID 1-877727288 . (Even though OTHER_DB will not have the body of that revision, the history will help it detect conflicts in future replications.) As with _all_or_nothing, this mode can create conflicts; in fact, this is where the conflicts created by replication come from.

For instance, in 2-def , 2 is called the \u201cgeneration\u201d and def the \u201cid\u201d. We update the document with a POST /bulk_docs query, with the following content: { \"docs\": [ { \"_id\": \"foo\", \"_rev\": \"3-ghi\", \"_revisions\": { \"start\": 3, \"ids\": [\"ghi\", \"xyz\", \"abc\"] } , \"bar\": \"racuda\" } ], \"new_edits\": false } This produces a conflict bewteen 2-def and 2-xyz : the former was first saved in database, but we forced the latter to be a new child of 1-abc .

In some cases, an integration with other softwares can be mandatory. It\u2019s possible to use JWT or OpenID Connect, with a bit of configuration to do that. JWT \u00b6 To enable an external system to create links with a JWT to log in users for cozy instances in a given context, we just need to add the secret to use for checking the JWT in the config, like this: authentication : the-context-name : jwt_secret : s3cr3t The external system can then create a JWT, with the parameter name as the instance domain, and send the user to https://<instance>/?jwt=... . The user will be logged in, and redirected to its default application. Open ID Connect \u00b6 OpenID Connect can also be used, and is more adapted when the users don\u2019t always come from the authentication provider. For OpenID Connect, there are more configuration parameters and they must be configured per context. A context is set of configuration parameters and each Cozy instance belongs to one context. authentication : the-context-name : disable_password_authentication : false oidc : client_id : aClientID client_secret : s3cret3 scope : openid profile login_domain : login.mycozy.cloud redirect_uri : https://oauthcallback.mycozy.cloud/oidc/redirect authorize_url : https://identity-provider/path/to/authorize token_url : https://identity-provider/path/to/token userinfo_url : https://identity-provider/path/to/userinfo userinfo_instance_field : cozy_number userinfo_instance_prefix : name userinfo_instance_suffix : .mycozy.cloud allow_custom_instance : false allow_oauth_token : false id_token_jwk_url : https://identity-provider/path/to/jwk Let\u2019s see what it means: disable_password_authentication can be set to true to disable the classic password authentication on the Cozy, and forces the user to login with OpenID Connect. And in the oidc section, we have: client_id and client_secret are the OAuth client that will be used to talk to the identity provider scope is the OAuth scope parameter (it is often openid profile ) login_domain is a domain that is not tied to an instance, but allows to login with OIDC with the provider configured on this context redirect_uri is where the user will be redirected by the identity provider after login (it must often be declared when creating the OAuth client, and we have to use a static hostname, not the hostname of a cozy instance) logout_url can be set to redirect the user to this URL after they have been logged out token_url , authorize_url , and userinfo_url are the URLs used to talk to the identity provider (they ofter can be found by the discovery mechanism of OpenID Connect with the names token_endpoint , authorization_endpoint , and userinfo_endpoint ) userinfo_instance_field is the JSON field to use in the UserInfo response to know the cozy instance of the logged in user. userinfo_instance_prefix and userinfo_instance_suffix are optional, and will be put before and after the field fetched from the UserInfo response to give the complete instance URL allow_custom_instance can be set to true to let the user chooses their instance name allow_oauth_token must be set to true to enable the POST /oidc/access_token route (see below for more details). With the example config, if the UserInfo response contains \"cozy_number\": \"00001\" , the user can login on the instance name00001.mycozy.cloud . When allow_custom_instance is set to true, the stack will look at the sub field in the UserInfo response, and checks that it matches the oidc_id set on this instance (and the userinfo_instance_* and login_domain fields are ignored). If id_token_jwk_url is set, the client can send the ID token from the provider instead of the access token. This token will be checked with the key fetched from this URL, and the sub field of it must match the oidc_id set in the instance. Routes \u00b6 Let\u2019s see the 3 routes used in this process GET /oidc/start \u00b6 To start the OpenID Connect dance, the user can go to this URL. It will redirect him/her to the identity provider with the rights parameter. The user will also be redirected here if they are not connected and that the password authentication is disabled.

It also has a bunch of exclusive features like the client-side connectors. But, to be able to work, it needs a very powerful access to the Cozy instance. Technically, it means that the flagship app is an OAuth client with a scope that covers everything. And we want to ensure that only the flagship can have this power. So, we require the application to be certified. It can be certified via the Google and Apple stores, and when it\u2019s not available, the user has the possibility to manually certify the flagship app (lineage OS users for example). Let\u2019s see the workflow when a user opens the flagship app for the first time. The app will load, and it will open a page of the cloudery for the onboarding. The user can type their email address, the cloudery sends an email, the user opens a link in this email, and then, we have two cases: the user already have a Cozy instance, or they want to create a new one. In both cases, the flagship will register its-self as an OAuth client on the Cozy and will type their passphrase before going to the home of the Cozy inside the flagship app. It is just that for a new Cozy, there are a few additional steps like accepting the terms of services. Note: the flagship app can be used with self-hosted stack. The user will have to type their Cozy address instead of using their email address, but everything else should work, including the certification via the Google and Apple stores (there are some config parameters, but they have a default value that make this possible). Create the OAuth client & certification \u00b6 When the flagship app knows the Cozy instance of the user, it will register itself as an OAuth client, and will try to attest that it is really the flagship app via the Google and Apple APIs. It is done by calling these 3 routes from the stack: POST /auth/register POST /auth/clients/:client-id/challenge POST /auth/clients/:client-id/attestation Between 2 and 3, the app will ask the mobile OS to certify that this is really the flagship app. It is done via the Play Integrity API (or SafetyNet attestation API ) on Android, and the AppAttest API on iOS. New Cozy instance \u00b6 On a new Cozy instance, the user will choose a passphrase that will be registered on the Cozy by sending its PBKDF2 hash to POST /settings/passphrase/flagship . Existing Cozy instance \u00b6 On an existing Cozy instance, the app will fetch some parameters with GET /public/prelogin , then the user can type their passphrase, and the PBKDF2 hash will be sent to POST /auth/login/flagship to give the app access to the whole Cozy. Magic link variant \u00b6 When magic link is enabled on a Cozy, the flagship app can use POST /auth/magic_link/flagship with a code sent by email to the user to get access to the Cozy. OIDC variant \u00b6 When a user uses an OIDC provider, or FranceConnect, the flagship app will get a delegated code from the cloudery and will use it via the POST /oidc/access_token endpoint to get access to the Cozy. Manual certification \u00b6 When the certification from the Google and Apple stores has failed, the app will have to do a few more steps to have access to the Cozy: Opening an in-app browser on the authorize page of the stack GET /auth/authorize?scope=* (note: PKCE is mandatory for the flagship app) The stack sends a mail with a 6 digits code in that case. The email explains that this code can be used to certify the flagship app. The user can type this code on the authorize page and submit it. It makes a POST /auth/clients/:client-id/flagship . If successful, it redirects back to the same page ( GET /auth/authorize?scope=* ), but this time, the user has button to accept using the flagship app. The user accepts, it sends a request to POST /auth/authorize , and the flagship app can finish the OAuth danse and have a full access on the Cozy. Special routes \u00b6 Some routes of the stack are dedicated to the flagship app, like: creating a session code with POST /auth/session_code getting a konnector token with POST /auth/tokens/konnectors/:slug getting the parameters to open a webapp with GET /apps/:slug/open And some routes accept a session_code to open a session in a webview or inAppBrowser, like: serving the index.html of a webapp starting the OAuth danse of a konnector ( /accounts/:slug/start ) starting the reconnect BI flow ( /accounts/:slug/reconnect ). Notifications \u00b6 When a notification is sent via the push channel, the stack will first try to send it to the dedicated mobile app. If there are no dedicated apps with a push token, the stack will then try to send the notification to the flagship apps. If it fails again, the stack then fallbacks on email. If the notification is sent to the flagship app, the title is modified to preprend the application name. By default, the notification slug is used but, if present, the name is taken from the appName field of the additional parameters ( data ). It allows the user to have more context when reading the notification on their mobile. The data.appName field can also be used to completely remove the application name from the notification title if set to an empty string.", "title": "Flagship app"}, {"location": "cozy-stack/flagship/#flagship-app", "text": "", "title": "Flagship App"}, {"location": "cozy-stack/flagship/#introduction", "text": "The flagship application is a mobile application that can be used to run all the Cozy webapps inside it.

December 2020: Jobs permissions \u00b6 We used to have a specific permission logic for jobs, in order to allow apps to direclty manage konnectors. More specifically, an app had the right to access a trigger state or remove it, if there was a doctype in common between the app permissions and the konnector manifest.

This change will be transparent for end-users. End-users don\u2019t need to change anything. Developpers that used to manually send POST /auth/login , POST /auth/passphrase_renew or POST /settings/passphrase requests will need to update their code. What are the changes \u00b6 Previously, we expected the user to type its passphrase on the browser. This passphrase was sent to the stack. There it was salted, hashed and compared to the salted-hashed version stored on our systems. From today, the browser will send an intermediary secret to the server instead of your passphrase. The rest of the process will stay unchanged. We\u2019ll salt and hash this intermediary secret ans compare it the the salted-hashed version stored on our system. The three API endpoint upper have been updated and now require you to pass this intermediary secret instead of the old passphrase. The settings endpoint will also expect a parameter with a number of pbkdf2 iterations. Dirty details for developers \u00b6 The intermediary secret is built from the user passphrase and the URL of its instance with the following formula: user - iterations = # from a / bitwarden / api / accounts / prelogin request user - salt = \"me@\" + host key = pbdkf2 ( passphrase , salt = user - salt , iterations = user - salt , alg = SHA - 256 ) secret = pbkdf2 ( key , salt = passphrase , iterations = 1 , alg = SHA - 256 ) \u2026where passphrase is the user passphrase in UTF-8 and host is the instance host string (without protocol, like \u201cexample.mycozy.cloud\u201d). The default iteration number in the first step ( user-iterations ) is a per-user settings set by the stack. You can find it by emitting a prelogin request . You can also see the user-salt and user-iterations in io.cozy.settings or through a GET /settings/passphrase request. For most of users, the today\u2019s default is 100_000 pbkdf2 iterations. Users initializing their account with a Edge browser will default to 10_000 iterations (Edge does not have a native pbkdf2 function and this is a balance between security and user experience). As always, if you have any doubt, you can explore our own source code. At the time of writing, there is a function nativeHash on password-helpers.js used on the login page of the stack.

The stack will intercept the passphrase sent by the browser, create the intermediary secret and store it salted-hashed for all future logins. Once the migration done, the stack will not allow direct passphrase logins anymore. Why this change \u00b6 Some content will support end-to-end encryption in the future.

Manifest 2. Intent Start 3. Service Resolution 4. Handshake 5. Processing & Terminating Routes Annexes Use cases Bibliography & Prior Art Discarded Ideas Overview \u00b6 A typical Cozy Cloud runs multiple applications, but most of these applications are focused on one task and interact with one particular type of data. However, Cozy Cloud especially shines when data is combined across apps to provide an integrated experience. This is made difficult by the fact that apps have no dedicated back-end and that they have restricted access to documents. This document outlines a proposal for apps to rely on each other to accomplish certain tasks and gain access to new documents, in a way that hopefully is neither painful for the users nor the developers. Glossary \u00b6 Intent : Intents, sometimes also called Activities, is a pattern used in environments where multiple apps with different purposes coexist. The idea is that any app can express the need to do something that it can\u2019t do itself, and an app that can do it will take over from there. Stack : refers to cozy-stack , the server-side part of the Cozy infrastructure. Client : the client is the application that starts an intent. Service : the service is the application that handles an intent started by a client. Available apps : Uninstalled applications that handles the intent. Proposal \u00b6 In this proposal, services declare themselves through their manifest. When a clients starts an intent, the stack finds the appropriate service and help the two apps to create a communication channel between them. After the channel is ready, the intent is processed. These steps are detailed below. 1. Manifest \u00b6 Every app can register itself as a potential handler for one or more intents. To do so, it must provide the following information for each intent it wishes to handle: action : A verb that describes what the service should do. The most common actions are CREATE , EDIT , OPEN , PICK , and SHARE . While we recommend using one of these verbs, the list is not exhaustive and may be extended by any app. type : One or more types of data on which the service knows how to operate the action . A type can be expressed as a MIME type or a Cozy Document Type . The application must have permissions for any Cozy Document Type listed here. You can also think of the type as the intent\u2019s subject. href : the relative URL of the route designed to handle this intent. A query-string with the intent id will be added to this URL. These informations must be provided in the manifest of the application, inside the intents key. Here is a very simple example: \"intents\" : [ { \"action\" : \"PICK\" , \"type\" : [ \"io.cozy.files\" ], \"href\" : \"/pick\" } ] When this service is called, it will load the page https://service.domain.example.com/pick?intent=123abc . Here is an example of an app that supports multiple data types: \"intents\" : [ { \"action\" : \"PICK\" , \"type\" : [ \"io.cozy.files\" , \"image/*\" ], \"href\" : \"/pick\" } ] Finally, here is an example of an app that supports several intent types: \"intents\" : [ { \"action\" : \"PICK\" , \"type\" : [ \"io.cozy.files\" , \"image/*\" ], \"href\" : \"/pick\" }, { \"action\" : \"VIEW\" , \"type\" : [ \"image/gif\" ], \"href\" : \"/viewer\" } ] This information is stored by the stack when the application is installed. 2. Intent Start \u00b6 Any app can start a new intent whenever it wants. When it does, the app becomes the client . To start an intent, it must specify the following information: action : an action verb, which will be matched against the actions declared in services manifest files. type : a single data type, which will be matched against the types declared in services manifest files. There are also two optional fields that can be defined at the start of the intent: data : Any data that the client wants to make available to the service. data must be a JSON object but its structure is left to the discretion of the client. The only exception is when type is a MIME type and the client wishes to send a file to the service. In that case, the file should be represented as a base-64 encoded Data URL and must be named content . This convention is also recomended when dealing with other intent type s. See the examples below for an example of this. permissions : When type is a Cozy Document Type and the client expects to receive one or more documents as part of the reply from the service, the permissions field allows the client to request permissions for these documents. permissions is a list of HTTP Verbs. Refer to this section of the permission documentation for more information. Note : if the intent\u2019s subject is a Cozy Doctype that holds references to other Cozy Documents (such as an album referencing photos or a playlist referencing music files), the permissions should be granted for the referenced documents too, whenever possible. Here is an example of what the API could look like: // \"Let the user pick a file\" cozy . intents . start ( 'PICK' , 'io.cozy.files' ) . then ( document => { // document is a JSON representation of the picked file }); // \"Create a contact, with some information already filled out\" cozy . intents . start ( 'CREATE' , 'io.cozy.contacts' , { name : 'John Johnsons' , tel : '+12345678' email : 'john@johnsons.com' }) . then ( document => { // document is a JSON representation of the contact that was created }); // \"Save this file somewhere\" cozy . intents . start ( 'CREATE' , 'io.cozy.files' , { content : 'data:application/zip;base64,UEsDB...' , name : 'photos.zip' }); // \"Create a new note, and give me read-only access to it\" cozy . intents . start ( 'CREATE' , 'io.cozy.notes' , {}, [ 'GET' ]) . then ( document => { // document is a JSON representation of the note that was created. // Additionally, this note can now be retrieved through the API since we have read access on it. }); // \"Create an event based on the provided data, and give me full access to it\" cozy . intents . start ( 'CREATE' , 'io.cozy.events' , { date : '2017/06/24' , title : 'Beach day' }, [ 'ALL' ]) . then ( document => { // document is a JSON representation of the note that was created. // Additionally, this note can now be retrieved through the API since we have read access on it. }); // \"Crop this picture\" cozy . intents . start ( 'EDIT' , 'image/png' , { content : 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw...' , width : 50 , height : 50 }) . then ( image => { //image is the edited version of the image provided above. }) 3. Service Resolution \u00b6 The service resolution is the phase where a service is chosen to handle an intent. This phase is handled by the stack. After the client has started it\u2019s intent, it sends the action , the type and the permissions to the stack. The stack will then traverse the list of installed apps and find all the apps that can handle that specific combination. Note that if the intent request GET permissions on a certain Cozy Document Type, but the service does not have this permission itself, it can not handle the intent. The stack then stores the information for that intent: A unique id for that intent Client URL Service URL action type permissions Finally, the service URL is suffixed with ?intent= followed by the intent\u2019s id, and then sent to the client. 4. Available apps \u00b6 In addition to the services that manage intents, a list of available (but not installed) applications of the instance that handles the intent is returned. This object list is called availableApps and contains: - The application slug - The application name Service choice \u00b6 If more than one service match the intent\u2019s criteria, the stack returns the list of all matching service URLs to the client (and stores it in the service URL version of the intent it keeps in memory). The client is then free to pick one arbitrarily. The client may also decide to let the user choose one of the services. To do this, it should start another intent with a PICK action and a io.cozy.apps type . This intent should be resolved by the stack to a special page, in order to avoid having multiple services trying to handle it and ending up in a loop. This special page is a service like any other; it expects the list of services to pick from as input data, and will return the one that has been picked to the client. The client can then proceed with the first intent. The user may decide to abort the intent before picking a service. If that is the case, the choice page will need to inform the client that the intent was aborted. No available service \u00b6 If no service is available to handle an intent, the stack returns an error to the client. However, some non-installed applications may handle the intent, and are listed in the availableApps field. 4. Handshake \u00b6 The next phase consist of the client and the service establishing a communication channel between them. The communication will be done using the window.postMessage API. Service Initialization \u00b6 When the client receives the service URL from the stack, it starts to listen for messages coming from that URL. Once the listener is started, it opens an iframe that points to the service\u2019s URL. Service to Client \u00b6 At this point, the service app is opened on the route that it provided in the href part of it\u2019s manifest. This route now also contains the intent\u2019s id. The service queries the stack to find out information about the intent, passing along the intent id. In response, the stack sends the client\u2019s URL, the action , and the type . If the intent includes permissions , the stack sends them too, as well as the client\u2019s permission id. It then starts to listen for messages coming from the client\u2019s URL. Eventually, it sends a message to the client, as a mean to inform it that the service is now ready. Client to Service \u00b6 After the client receives the \u201cready\u201d message from the service, it sends a message to the service acknowledging the \u201cready\u201d state. Along with this message, it should send the data that was provided at the start of the intent, if any. 5. Processing & Terminating \u00b6 After this handshake, there is a confirmed communication channel between the client and the service, and the service knows what it has to do. This is the phase where the user interacts with the service. If the service is going to grant extra permissions to the client app, it is strongly recommended to make this clear to the user. When the service has finished his task, it sends a \u201ccompleted\u201d message to the client. Permissions extensions should have been done before that. Along with the completed message, the service should send any data it deems relevant. This data should be a JSON object. Again, the structure of that object is left to the discretion of the service, except when type is a MIME type. In that case, the file should be represented as a base-64 encoded Data URL and must be named content . This convention is also recomended when dealing with other intent type s. After the client receives a \u201ccompleted\u201d message, it can close the service\u2019s iframe and resume operations as usual. If, for whatever reason, the service can not fulfill the intent, it can send an \u201cerror\u201d message to the client. When the client receives an \u201cerror\u201d message, the intent is aborted and the iframe can be closed. Routes \u00b6 POST /intents \u00b6 The client app can ask to start an intent via this route. Any client-side app can call this route, no permission is needed. Request \u00b6 POST /intents HTTP / 1.1 Host : cozy.example.net Authorization : Bearer eyJhbG...

Since we were unable to find a use case where a new window is required, we decided not to include the disposition in this specification. It might be added later if the need arises.

This would be useful as the stack could act as a middleware, transforming data on the fly or granting permissions where appropriate. However, this approach has also severe drawbacks, notably the fact that the stack must hold a copy of all the data that the apps want to transfer (which can include large files). It also makes it significantly harder for the client to know when the intent has been processed. Data representation \u00b6 The client could explicitly request a data format to be used in the communication.

While we recommend using one of these verbs, the list is not exhaustive and may be extended by any app. type : One or more types of data on which the service knows how to operate the action .

There are also two optional fields that can be defined at the start of the intent: data : Any data that the client wants to make available to the service. data must be a JSON object but its structure is left to the discretion of the client. The only exception is when type is a MIME type and the client wishes to send a file to the service.

These tasks can be scheduled in advance, recurring or sudden and provide various services. At the time, we do not provide \u201cgeneric\u201d and programmable tasks. This list of available workers is part of the defined API. The job queue can be either local to the cozy-stack when used as a monolithic instance (self-hosted for instance) or distributed via a redis server for distributed infrastructures. This doc introduces two cozy types: io.cozy.jobs for jobs io.cozy.triggers for triggers Triggers \u00b6 Jobs can be queued up via the /jobs/queue/:worker-type API, for a direct execution. But it can also be convenient to schedule jobs on some conditions, and the triggers are the way to do that. Jobs can be launched by different types of triggers: @at to schedule a one-time job executed after at a specific time in the future @in to schedule a one-time job executed after a specific amount of time @hourly to schedule jobs that run once an hour @daily to schedule jobs that run once a day @weekly to schedule jobs that run once a week @monthly to schedule jobs that run once a month @every to schedule periodic jobs executed at a given fix interval @cron to schedule recurring jobs scheduled at specific times @event to launch a job after a change on documents in the cozy @webhook to launch a job when an HTTP request hit a specific URL @client when the client controls when the job are launched. These triggers have specific syntaxes to describe when jobs should be scheduled. See below for more informations. @at syntax \u00b6 The @at trigger takes a ISO-8601 formatted string indicating a UTC time in the future. The date is of this form: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ Be aware that the @at trigger is removed from the doctype after it has created the associated job. Examples @at 2018-12-12T15:36:25.507Z @in syntax \u00b6 The @in trigger takes the same duration syntax as @every Be aware that the @in trigger is removed from the doctype after it has created the associated job. Examples @in 10m @in 1h30m @daily syntax \u00b6 The @daily trigger will create a job once a day. By default, the stack is free to choose the day and hour when to do that, but you can add restrictions: @daily # Once a day, any hour @daily before 5 am # Once a day, between midnight and 5am (UTC) @daily after 10 pm # Once a day, between 10pm and midnight (UTC) @daily between 8 am and 6 pm # Once a day, between 8am and 6pm (UTC) @weekly syntax \u00b6 The @weekly trigger will create a job once a week. By default, the stack is free to choose the day and hour when to do that, but you can add restrictions: @weekly # Once a week, any day, any hour @weekly on monday # Every monday @weekly on mon , wed , fri # Once a week, on a monday, wednesday, or friday @weekly on wed - fri # Once a week, on a wednesday, thursday, or friday @weekly on weekday # Once a week, but not the week-end @weekly on weekend # Every week-end (saturday or sunday) @weekly before 5 am # Once a week, any day, but between midnight and 5am (UTC) @weekly after 10 pm # Once a week, any day, but between 10pm and midnight (UTC) @weekly between 8 am and 6 pm # Once a week, any day, between 8am and 6pm (UTC) @weekly on monday before 9 am # Every monday, between midnight and 9am (UTC) @monthly syntax \u00b6 The @monthly trigger will create a job once a month. By default, the stack is free to choose the day and hour when to do that, but you can add restrictions: @monthly # Once a month, any day, any hour @monthly on the 1 # Every first day of the month @monthly on the 1 - 5 # Once a month, on the first five days of the month @monthly before 5 am # Once a month, any day, but between midnight and 5am (UTC) @monthly after 10 pm # Once a month, any day, but between 10pm and midnight (UTC) @monthly between 8 am and 6 pm # Once a month, any day, between 8am and 6pm (UTC) @monthly on the 1 before 9 am # Every first day of the month, between midnight and 9am (UTC) Note: the current implementation is to take a random day/hour and run the job each month at this day/hour. So, you should avoid 29-31 if you really want the job to run each month. @every syntax \u00b6 The @every trigger uses the same syntax as golang\u2019s time.ParseDuration (but only support time units above seconds): A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as \u201c300ms\u201d, \u201c1.5h\u201d or \u201c2h45m\u201d. Valid time units are \u201cs\u201d, \u201cm\u201d, \u201ch\u201d. Examples @every 1.5h # schedules every 1 and a half hours @every 30m10s # schedules every 30 minutes and 10 seconds @cron syntax \u00b6 In order to schedule recurring jobs, the @cron trigger has the syntax using six fields: Field name Mandatory? Allowed values Allowed special characters Seconds Yes 0-59 * / , - Minutes Yes 0-59 * / , - Hours Yes 0-23 * / , - Day of month Yes 1-31 * / , - ? Month Yes 1-12 or JAN-DEC * / , - Day of week Yes 0-6 or SUN-SAT * / , - ? Asterisk ( * ) The asterisk indicates that the cron expression will match for all values of the field; e.g., using an asterisk in the 5th field (month) would indicate every month. Slash ( / ) Slashes are used to describe increments of ranges. For example 3-59/15 in the 1st field (minutes) would indicate the 3rd minute of the hour and every 15 minutes thereafter. The form \"*\\/...\" is equivalent to the form \"first-last/...\" , that is, an increment over the largest possible range of the field. The form \"N-/...\" is accepted as meaning \"N-MAX/...\" , that is, starting at N, use the increment until the end of that specific range. It does not wrap around. Comma ( , ) Commas are used to separate items of a list. For example, using \"MON,WED,FRI\" in the 5th field (day of week) would mean Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Hyphen ( - ) Hyphens are used to define ranges. For example, 9-17 would indicate every hour between 9am and 5pm inclusive. Question mark ( ? ) Question mark may be used instead of * for leaving either day-of-month or day-of-week blank. To schedule jobs given an interval: Examples: @cron 0 0 0 1 1 * # Run once a year, midnight, Jan. 1st @cron 0 0 0 1 1 * # Run once a year, midnight, Jan. 1st @cron 0 0 0 1 * * # Run once a month, midnight, first of month @cron 0 0 0 * * 0 # Run once a week, midnight on Sunday @cron 0 0 0 * * * # Run once a day, midnight @cron 0 0 * * * * # Run once an hour, beginning of hour @event syntax \u00b6 The @event syntax allows to trigger a job when something occurs in the stack. It follows the same syntax than permissions scope string: type[:verb][:values][:selector] Unlike for permissions string, the verb should be one of CREATED , DELETED , UPDATED . It is possible to put several verbs, separated by a comma. There is also a special value != . It means that a job will be trigger only if the value for the given selector has changed (ie the value before the update and the value after that are different). The job worker will receive a compound message including original trigger_infos messages and the event which has triggered it. Examples: @event io.cozy.files // anything happens on files @event io.cozy.files:CREATED // a file was created @event io.cozy.files:DELETED:image/jpg:mime // an image was deleted @event io.cozy.bank.operations:CREATED io.cozy.bank.bills:CREATED // a bank operation or a bill @event io.cozy.bank.operations:CREATED,UPDATED // a bank operation created or updated @event io.cozy.bank.operations:UPDATED:!=:category // a change of category for a bank operation @webhook syntax \u00b6 It takes no parameter. The URL to hit is not controlled by the request, but is chosen by the server (and is returned as webhook in the links JSON-API response). Example: @webhook @client syntax \u00b6 It takes no parameter and can only by used for the client worker. The stack won\u2019t create a job unless a client calls the launch endpoint for this trigger. The main goal of this trigger is keep a state, as the aggregation of job results. Error Handling \u00b6 Jobs can fail to execute their task. We have two ways to parameterize such cases. Retry \u00b6 A retry count can be optionally specified to ask the worker to re-execute the task if it has failed. Each retry is executed after a configurable delay. The try count is part of the attributes of the job. Also, each occurring error is kept in the errors field containing all the errors that may have happened. Timeout \u00b6 A worker may never end. To prevent this, a configurable timeout value is specified with the job. If a job does not end after the specified amount of time, it will be aborted. A timeout is just like another error from the worker and can provoke a retry if specified. Defaults \u00b6 By default, jobs are parameterized with a maximum of 3 tries with 1 minute timeout. These defaults may vary given the workload of the workers. Jobs API \u00b6 Example and description of the attributes of a io.cozy.jobs : { \"domain\" : \"me.cozy.localhost\" , \"worker\" : \"sendmail\" , // worker type name \"options\" : { \"timeout\" : 60 , // timeout value in seconds \"max_exec_count\" : 3 , // maximum number of time the job should be executed (including retries) }, \"arguments\" : { // the arguments will be given to the worker (if you look in CouchDB, it is called message there) \"mode\" : \"noreply\" , \"template_name\" : \"new_registration\" , \"template_values\" : { \"DevicesLink\" : \"http://me.cozy.localhost/#/connectedDevices\" , } }, \"state\" : \"running\" , // queued, running, done, errored \"queued_at\" : \"2016-09-19T12:35:08Z\" , // time of the queuing \"started_at\" : \"2016-09-19T12:35:08Z\" , // time of first execution \"error\" : \"\" // error message if any } Example and description of a job creation options \u2014 as you can see, the options are replicated in the io.cozy.jobs attributes: { \"timeout\" : 60 , // timeout value in seconds \"max_exec_count\" : 3 , // maximum number of retry } GET /jobs/:job-id \u00b6 Get a job informations given its ID.

Worker pool \u00b6 The consuming side of the job queue is handled by a worker pool. On a monolithic cozy-stack, the worker pool has a configurable fixed size of workers. The default value is not yet determined. Each time a worker has finished a job, it check the queue and based on the priority and the queued date of the job, picks a new job to execute. Permissions \u00b6 In order to prevent jobs from leaking informations between applications, we may need to add filtering per applications: for instance one queue per applications. We should also have an explicit check on the permissions of the applications before launching a job scheduled by an application. For more information, refer to our permission document . Multi-stack \u00b6 When some instances are served by several stacks, the scheduling and running of jobs can be distributed on the stacks. The synchronization is done via redis. For scheduling, there is one important key in redis: triggers . It\u2019s a sorted set. The members are the identifiants of the triggers (with the domain name), and the score are the timestamp of the next time the trigger should occur. During the short period of time where a trigger is processed, its key is moved to scheduling (another sorted set). So, even if a stack crash during processing a trigger, this trigger won\u2019t be lost. For @event triggers, we don\u2019t use the same mechanism. Each stack has all the triggers in memory and is responsible to trigger them for the events generated by the HTTP requests of their API. They also publish them on redis: this pub/sub is used for the realtime API.", "title": "/jobs - Jobs"}, {"location": "cozy-stack/jobs/#jobs", "text": "Jobs are designed to represent asynchronous tasks that your cozy can execute.

So, even if a stack crash during processing a trigger, this trigger won\u2019t be lost. For @event triggers, we don\u2019t use the same mechanism.

Decryption \u00b6 The decryption of the credentials is reserved to requests coming from konnectors and services. For services, it is only available on /data/io.cozy.acconts/:account-id with an additional include=credentials parameter. Aggregator accounts \u00b6 Some konnectors are based on an aggregator service. An aggregator is declared in the konnector manifest and specify an accountId property. When Cozy-Home detects this property, it checks if an account with this given id exists. If not, it creates it. Every account created for a konnector based on an aggregator is then related to this aggregator account. This relationship is called parent account. { \"auth\" : { \"login\" : \"000000000\" , \"password\" : \"**********\" }, \"folderPath\" : \"/Administratif/Bankbank\" , \"label\" : \"Bankbank\" , \"namePath\" : \"Bankbank\" , \"relationships\" : { \"parent\" : { \"data\" : { \"_id\" : \"service-aggregator-account\" , \"_type\" : \"io.cozy.accounts\" } } } } Note: you can read more about the accounts doctype here . Konnectors \u00b6 io.cozy.konnectors are installed similarly to io.cozy.apps (see doc ) Permissions \u00b6 Like client-side applications, each konnector has an associated io.cozy.permissions . These permissions are those listed on the manifest of the konnectors, and the stack will add a permission for the files on the folder choosen by the user. Triggers \u00b6 io.cozy.triggers are used to define when konnectors are launched. See https://docs.cozy.io/en/cozy-stack/jobs/#post-jobstriggers Complete flow example \u00b6 As a user, from the expenses management app, I have a clean flow to configure a connector to retrieve my travel expenses 1 - User is in my-expenses and clicks on [configure travels] 2 - my-expenses triggers an intent cozy . intents . start ( \"CREATE\" , \"io.cozy.konnectors\" , { category : \"transport\" }); 3 - the Store app catch the intent, fetch all available konnectors and let the user choose GET /registry?... HTTP / 1.1 4 - the user chooses the trainline konnector. Its manifest looks like this: { \"name\" : \"Trainline\" , \"type\" : \"konnector\" , \"slug\" : \"konnector-trainline\" , \"description\" : \"Konnector for trainline . com\" , \"source\" : \"https://github.com/konnectors/trainlines.git@build\" , \"developer\" : { \"name\" : \"XXX\" , \"url\" : \"https://www.xxx.fr\" }, \"version\" : \"3.0.0\" , \"licence\" : \"AGPL-3.0\" , \"fields\" : { \"login\" : { \"type\" : \"text\" }, \"password\" : { \"type\" : \"password\" }, \"advancedFields\" : { \"folderPath\" : { \"advanced\" : true , \"isRequired\" : false } } }, \"category\" : \"transport\" , \"frequency\" : \"weekly\" , \"permissions\" : { \"events\" : { \"description\" : \"Connect train bill with event in your calendar\" , \"type\" : \"io.cozy.events\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"PATCH\" ] } } } 5 - the user clicks on install, and the install starts: POST /konnectors/trainline HTTP / 1.1 6 - the Store then uses an intent to know which app can configure this konnector: cozy . intents . start ( \"REDIRECT\" , \"io.cozy.accounts\" , { slug : \"trainline\" }); 7 - the Store redirects to the Home. The Home asks the user for account config and create a folder to save the PDFs. 8 - the Home also add a Reference from the konnector to the folder to prevent any accidental folder deletion: POST /files/123-selected-folder-id-123/relationships/referenced_by { \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.konnectors\" , \"id\" : \"io.cozy.konnectors/trainlines\" } ] } 9 - then the Home can create the account: POST /data/io.cozy.accounts HTTP / 1.1 { \"account_type\" : \"trainline\" , \"auth\" : { \"login\" : \"xxxx\" , \"password\" : \"yyyyy\" }, \"folderPath\" : \"/Administrative/Trainline\" } HTTP / 1.1 200 OK { \"_id\" : \"123-account-id-123\" , \"_rev\" : \"1-asasasasa\" , \"account_type\" : \"trainline\" , \"auth\" : { \"login\" : \"xxxx\" }, \"folderPath\" : \"/Administrative/Trainline\" } 10 - the Home create the trigger: POST /jobs/io.cozy.triggers { \"data\" : { \"attributes\" : { \"type\" : \"@cron\" , \"arguments\" : \"0 0 0 0 1 1 \" , \"worker\" : \"konnector\" , \"message\" : { \"konnector\" : \"trainline\" , \"account\" : \"5165621628784562148955\" , \"folder_to_save\" : \"877854878455\" } } } } 11 - and, finally, the Home runs the konnector for the first time: POST /jobs/triggers/abc159753/launch HTTP / 1.1 12 - the Home uses the realtime to be informed if the konnector fails to login or succeeds to import the PDFs. If the user wants to use several account, the Home can setup several triggers for the same konnector & various accounts. Konnector Worker specs \u00b6 Prepare the execution \u00b6 The cozy-stack prepares the execution of the konnector by doing these steps: it checks that the konnector is not in maintenance in the registry (except for manual execution) it ensures that the konnector has a folder where it can write its files, and has the permission to write in this folder. Execute the konnector \u00b6 Start the konnector through nsjail, passing as ENV variables: - `COZY_URL`: the starting instance URL - `COZY_CREDENTIALS`: security token to communicate with Cozy - `COZY_FIELDS`: JSON-encoded message with the arguments from the trigger - `COZY_PAYLOAD`: JSON-encoded payload from the HTTP request (@webhook trigger) - `COZY_PARAMETERS`: JSON-encoded parameters from the konnector manifest - `COZY_LANGUAGE`: the language field of the konnector (eg. \"node\" etc.) - `COZY_LOCALE`: the locale of the user (eg. \"en\" etc.) - `COZY_TIME_LIMIT`: how much time the konnector can run before being killed - `COZY_JOB_ID`: id of the job - `COZY_TRIGGER_ID`: id of the trigger that has created the job - `COZY_JOB_MANUAL_EXECUTION`: whether the job was started manually (in Home) or automatically (via a cron trigger or event) The konnector process can send events trough its stdout (newline separated JSON object), the konnector worker pass these events to the realtime hub as io.cozy.jobs.events . Only JSON formatted events are forwarded to the client-side through realtime Otherwise formatted lines (such as node Error) will be kept in some system logs. Konnectors should NOT log the received account login values in production. Konnector error handling \u00b6 The konnector can output json formated messages as stated before (the events) and those events will be typed and formatted like this: { type : \"messagetype\" , // can be \"debug\", \"info\", \"warning\", \"error\", and \"critical\" message : \"message\" // can be any string } If there is an error or critical message, the execution will be seen as a failure by cozy-stack. It\u2019s also the case if the konnector reaches the timeout or returns with a non-zero status code. Note: debug and info level are not transmitted to syslog, except if the instance is in debug mode. It would be too verbose to do otherwise. The message can start with a known keyword that could have special meanings for cozy-stack or for statistical analysis of konnector health. Known keywords are listed in the konnector tutorial When a connector throw an error of either LOGIN_FAILED or any error starting with USER_ACTION_NEEDED (with the exception of USER_ACTION_NEEDED.CGU_FORM ), meaning that the user needs to execute an action on provider\u2019s website (either changing its credentials or acknowledging something on provider website), then cozy-stack will skip all subsequent automatic executions to avoid querying the provider site and blocking user account. Manual execution by the user will still be possible to unlock the konnector/account when the user thinks it is now ready to be run again. Account deleted \u00b6 When an account is deleted, or a konnector is going to be uninstalled, the konnector is executed with the account_deleted field to true, so it can clean the account remotely. OAuth (and service secrets) \u00b6 Doctypes \u00b6 io.cozy.konnectors gives their desiderata for an account { \"fields\" : { \"account\" : { \"doctype\" : \"io.cozy.accounts\" , \"account_type\" : \"maif\" , \"scope\" : \"openid profile offline_access\" } } } io.cozy.accounts contains authentication information for an account, as well as the associated scope { \"name\" : \"Mon Compte Maif\" , \"account_type\" : \"maif\" , \"status\" : \"connected\" , \"oauth\" : { \"access_token\" : \"akosaksoakso\" , \"refresh_token\" : \"okoakozkaozk\" , \"scope\" : \"openid profile offline_access\" } } io.cozy.account_types contains the oauth configuration: { \"_id\" : \"service.example\" , \"grant_mode\" : \"authorization_code\" , \"client_id\" : \"the registered client id\" , \"client_secret\" : \"client_secret is necessary for server-flow\" , \"auth_endpoint\" : \"https://service.example/auth\" , \"token_endpoint\" : \"https://api.service.example/token\" } io.cozy.account_types are not accessible to the applications: they are injected directly in CouchDB in a global database secrets/io-cozy-account_types . Secrets that are not OAuth \u00b6 The io.cozy.account_types doctype can also be used for storing secrets that are not related to OAuth. The document still need to be injected manually in secrets/io-cozy-account_types : { \"_id\": \"service.example\", \"grant_mode\": \"secret\", \"slug\": \"service\", \"secret\": \"th1$_1$_th3_s3cr3t!\" } Note : grant_mode must be secret (or bi_webauth+secret , or bi_webview+secret , or authorization_code+secret ), slug must be the slug of the konnector, but secret can be a map instead of a simple string if several secrets are needed for this service. The secret is given to the konnector in the COZY_PARAMETERS env variable. Overloading an account type for a given context \u00b6 It is possible to use a different account type for a given context, by creating a new document with an id prefix by the context name and / . For example, a different secret can be used in the foobar context by injecting this document in secrets/io-cozy-account_types : { \"_id\": \"foobar/service.example\", \"grant_mode\": \"secret\", \"slug\": \"service\", \"secret\": \"th1$_1$_n0t_th3_s4m3_s3cr3t!\" } Reminder OAuth flow \u00b6 Service is the website from which konnector aims to retrieve informations. Stack is the cozy stack. OAuth is divided in 3 steps: Client Registration: the client application (the Stack) needs to be registered with the Service Obtaining & Refreshing Authorization: all the steps from client_id to access_token , the Stack will handle those Using the access_token : ideally, the konnector should only concern itself with this part; it receives an access_token and uses it. Client Registration \u00b6 Before beginning the Grant process, most Services require the application to be registered with a defined redirect_uri . There are a lot of options, which we will choose from when actually implementing konnectors using them. Manually \u00b6 Most services requires a human developer to create the client manually and define its redirect_uri. However each instance has its own domain, so for these services, we will need to: A. Register a \u201cproxy\u201d client , which is a static page performing redirections as needed, as was done for Facebook events in v2 konnectors. We will register a well known cozy domain, like oauth-proxy.cozy.io and registers it with all providers. The use and risks associated with this domain should be made clear to the user. B. Register each Stack with a redirect_uri on the main stack domain, if we go this way, the register_uri below moves from bob.cozy.rocks/accounts/service/redirect to oauthcallback.cozy.rocks/accounts/service/redirect and the domain will be prepended to the state. This is feasible at cozy scale, but requires more knowledge and work for self-hosters. Example: Google \u00b6 For example, these are the steps for creating the google account_type for the stack at .mycozy.cloud: Go to https://console.developers.google.com Select or Create Project (up left near the logo) Enable desired APIs (TBD with usages) Click \u201cCredentials\u201d Create credentials > Oauth Client ID > Web application Set redirectURI to https://oauthcallback.mycozy.cloud/accounts/google/redirect Copy and paste provided Client ID and Client Secret. Then save the data in the console http PUT localhost:5984/secrets%2Fio-cozy-account_types/google grant_mode=authorization_code redirect_uri=\"https://oauthcallback.mycozy.cloud/accounts/google/redirect\" token_mode=basic token_endpoint=\"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token\" auth_endpoint=\"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth\" client_id=$CLIENT_ID client_secret=$CLIENT_SECRET Dynamic Registration Protocol \u00b6 A few services allows client to register programatically through the Dynamic Client Registration Protocol RFC7591 , we should allow the Stack to register using this protocol when we first need to implement a Konnector connecting to such a Service. No redirect_url enforcement \u00b6 A few services allows to specify arbitrary redirect_url without registering beforehand as a client. Authorization Grant flows \u00b6 webserver flow (Authorization Code Grant) \u00b6 A. In the cozy app (Home) give a link < a href = \"https://bob.cozy.rocks/accounts/service-name/start? scope=photos& state=1234zyx\" > Notes: the scope may depends on other fields being configured (checkboxes), this will be described in json in the konnectors manifest. The format will be determined upon implementation; to limit bandwidth and risk of state corruption, the cozy app should save its state under a random key into localStorage, the key is then passed as the state in this query; a third parameter, slug , can be added to redirect to this app instead of the home. B. Service lets the user login, allows or denies the scope, then redirects to https://oauthcallback.cozy.rocks/accounts/service-name/redirect? code=AUTH_CODE_HERE& state=1234zyx C. The Stack does Server side this request: POST /oauth/access_token HTTP / 1.1 Host : api.service.example Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded grant_type=authorization_code& code=AUTH_CODE_HERE& redirect_uri=https://oauthcallback.cozy.rocks/accounts/service-name/redirect& client_id=CLIENT_ID& client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET Note: the stack will also send the state parameter on this request. It is not mandatory per the OAuth 2.0 spec, and the skip_state_on_token option can be used to cancel this behavior if the provider throw an error if this parameter is present. D. The Service responds (server side) with: { \"access_token\" : \"ACCESS_TOKEN\" , \"token_type\" : \"bearer\" , \"expires_in\" : 2592000 , \"refresh_token\" : \"REFRESH_TOKEN\" , \"scope\" : \"read\" , \"uid\" : 100101 , \"info\" : { \"name\" : \"Claude Douillet\" , \"email\" : \"claude.douillet@example.com\" } } This whole object is saved as-is into a io.cozy.accounts \u2018s extras field. The known fields access_token , refresh_token & scope will be also saved on the account\u2019s oauth itself E. The Stack redirect the user to the cozy app: HTTP / 1.1 302 Found Location : https://bob-home.cozy.rocks/?state=1234zyx&account=accountID The Cozy app checks that the state is expected, and restores its state to the form but whith account completed. SPA flow (Implicit grant) \u00b6 A. The cozy app gives a link: < a href = \"https://service.example/auth? (url) response_type=token& client_id=CLIENT_ID& redirect_uri=https://bob-home.cozy.rocks/& scope=photos& state=1234zyx\" > See server-flow for state rules. B. Service lets the user login, allows or denies the scope, then redirects to https://bob-home.cozy.rocks/?access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN&state=1234zyx C. The Cozy app adds the token to the io.cozy.accounts and save it before starting konnector. Accessing data \u00b6 Once we have an account, the Cozy app starts the konnector with the proper account id. The konnector can then fetch the account and use its access_token to performs a request to fetch data: POST /resource HTTP / 1.1 Host : api.service.example Authorization : Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN Refreshing token \u00b6 When using the server-flow, we also get a refresh_token. It is used to get a new access_token when it expires. However, if konnectors are responsible for refreshing token there is a race condition risk: (konnector A) GET https://api.service.com/resource TOKEN1 -> expired (konnector B) GET https://api.service.com/resource TOKEN1 -> expired (konnector A) POST https://api.service.com/token REFRESH_TOKEN -> TOKEN2a (konnector B) POST https://api.service.com/token REFRESH_TOKEN -> TOKEN2b (konnector A) GET https://api.service.com/token TOKEN2a -> invalid To avoid this, the stack will be responsible to perform token refresh. A konnector can requires the stack to refresh an account token with an HTTP request. POST /accounts/:accountType/:accountID/refresh HTTP / 1.1 Host : bob.cozy.rocks Konnectors Marketplace Requirements \u00b6 The following is a few points to be careful for in konnectors when we start allowing non-cozy developped OAuth konnectors. With SPA flow, because of advanced security concerns (confused deputy problem), cozy should validate the access_token . However, the way to do that depends on the provider and cannot be described in json, it is therefore the responsibility of the konnector itself. Account types security rules \u00b6 With server flow, an evil account type with proper auth_endpoint but bad token_endpoint could retrieve a valid token as well as cozy client secret. The reviewer of an account_type should make sure both these endpoints are on domains belonging to the Service provider. Notes for MesInfos experiment \u00b6 MAIF konnector uses the webserver flow without redirect_uri validation Orange konnector uses the client-side proxy but hosted on their own servers (/!\\ redirect_uri vs redirect_url) Webauth \u00b6 For some banks integration (Paypal, Orange Bank, Revolut\u2026), Budget Insight has a workflow similar to OAuth called Webauth . It is possible to use this workflow for konnectors by registering an account type with the following parameter: grant_mode , with bi_webauth as the value (or bi_webauth+secret if there is also a secret) redirect_uri , with an URL like https://oauthcallback.mycozy.cloud/accounts/paypal/redirect client_id , with the client ID given by Budget Insight auth_endpoint , with https://{domain}.biapi.pro/2.0/webauth (with the correct domain ) reconnect_endpoint , with https://{domain}.biapi.pro/2.0/auth/webview/reconnect (idem). BI Weview \u00b6 A new integration of Budget Insight is available for all the proposed banks. This is a workflow similar to OAuth called webview It is possible to use this workflow for konnectors by registering an account type with the following parameter: grant_mode , with bi_webview+secret as the value redirect_uri , with an URL like https://oauthcallback.mycozy.cloud/accounts/paypal/redirect client_id , with the client ID given by Budget Insight auth_endpoint , with https://{domain}.biapi.pro/2.0/auth/webview/fr/connect (with the correct domain ) manage_endpoint , with https://{domain}.biapi.pro/2.0/auth/webview/reconnect (idem). reconnect_endpoint , with https://{domain}.biapi.pro/2.0/auth/webview/reconnect (idem). Manage \u00b6 The manage webview can be called with this route: GET /accounts/:accountType/:accountID/manage?code={code}&connection_id={id}&slug={slug}&state={state} HTTP / 1.1 Host : jane.cozy.example HTTP / 1.1 303 See Other Location : https://domain.biapi.pro/2.0/auth/webview/manage ?client_id={client_id} &code={code} &connection_id={id} &redirect_uri=https://oauthcallback.cozy.example/accounts/{accountType}/redirect &state={stackState} At the end of flow, the user will be redirected to https://jane-{slug}.cozy.example/?state={state} . Reconnect \u00b6 The reconnection webview can be called with this route: GET /accounts/:accountType/:accountID/reconnect?code={code}&connection_id={id}&slug={slug}&state={state} HTTP / 1.1 Host : jane.cozy.example HTTP / 1.1 303 See Other Location : https://domain.biapi.pro/2.0/auth/webview/reconnect ?client_id={client_id} &code={code} &connection_id={id} &redirect_uri=https://oauthcallback.cozy.example/accounts/{accountType}/redirect &state={stackState} At the end of flow, the user will be redirected to https://jane-{slug}.cozy.example/?state={state} . Webhook triggers \u00b6 The cloudery (or an application) can install the konnector and create an account It can also create the webhook trigger via a POST /jobs/triggers Request: POST /jobs/triggers HTTP / 1.1 Host : jane.cozy.example Content-Type : application/vnd.api+json { \"data\" : { \"attributes\" : { \"type\" : \"@webhook\" , \"worker\" : \"konnector\" , \"message\" : { \"param_from_trigger\" : \"foo\" } } } } Response: HTTP / 1.1 200 OK Content-Type : application/vnd.api+json { \"data\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.triggers\" , \"id\" : \"0915b6b0-0c97-0139-5af7-543d7eb8149c\" , \"attributes\" : { \"type\" : \"@webhook\" , \"worker\" : \"konnector\" , \"message\" : { \"konnector\" : \"mykonnector\" , \"param_from_trigger\" : \"foo\" } }, \"links\" : { \"self\" : \"/jobs/triggers/0915b6b0-0c97-0139-5af7-543d7eb8149c\" , \"webhook\" : \"https://jane.cozy.example/jobs/webhooks/0915b6b0-0c97-0139-5af7-543d7eb8149c\" } } } The cloudery can then give the webhook URL to the external service When the external service has new documents to import, it can call the webhook Request: POST /jobs/webhooks/0915b6b0-0c97-0139-5af7-543d7eb8149c HTTP / 1.1 Host : jane.cozy.example Content-Type : application/json { \"param_from_http_body\" : \"bar\" } Response: HTTP / 1.1 204 No Content The stack will put a job in its queue for the konnector The stack executes the konnector with: COZY_FIELDS={\"param_from_trigger\": \"foo\"} COZY_PAYLOAD={\"param_from_http_body\": \"bar\"} etc. Note: the environnement variables have a limit for their size defined by the linux kernel. If the payload is too big to fit inside the env variable, the stack will put the payload in a temporary file, and will set the COZY_PAYLOAD variable to @ + the filename of this file, like: COZY_PAYLOAD=@cozy_payload.json The konnector will fetch the documents from the external service and save them in the Cozy. Note: if the trigger has a debounce, the COZY_PAYLOAD will be an object with a payloads array, like this: COZY_PAYLOAD ={ \"payloads\" : [{ \"param_from_http_body\" : \"bar\" }]}", "title": "Workflow of the konnectors"}, {"location": "cozy-stack/konnectors-workflow/#konnectors-workflow", "text": "", "title": "Konnectors workflow"}, {"location": "cozy-stack/konnectors-workflow/#tldr", "text": "", "title": "TL;DR"}, {"location": "cozy-stack/konnectors-workflow/#types", "text": "", "title": "Types"}, {"location": "cozy-stack/konnectors-workflow/#accounts", "text": "io.cozy.accounts contains information for an account, including those for authentication (technically, they are encrypted by cozy-stack before being saved in CouchDB, but we will show them as the konnectors will see them): { \"auth\" : { \"login\" : \"000000000\" , \"password\" : \"**********\" }, \"folderPath\" : \"/Administratif/Free Mobile\" , \"label\" : \"freemobile\" , \"namePath\" : \"Free Mobile\" } Accounts are manipulated through the /data/ API.", "title": "Accounts"}, {"location": "cozy-stack/konnectors-workflow/#decryption", "text": "The decryption of the credentials is reserved to requests coming from konnectors and services.

We have made this important promise to our users, and moving a Cozy to a new hoster/address is a big part of it. That\u2019s why we have tried hard to make it smooth and robust. It means that we had to manage some complex special cases. This document is here to keep a trace of them. But, first, let\u2019s define what moving a Cozy means. When you have an instance, the \u201csource\u201d, and another instance, the \u201ctarget\u201d, the user can move their usage from the source to the target. The data is exported from the source instance, and imported on the target instance. But there is more than that. For example, the Cozy to Cozy sharings ( documentation ) will be updated to work the target instance instead of the source instance. Workflows \u00b6 Technically, a new component called Cozy-Move was created. It is a web application in Elixir/Phoenix that can be seen as a wizard to help users select from which instance and to which instance they want to move. It is possible to send a mail with a link to cozy-move, and put this link in a FAQ, and users can start the process from this link. But, if a user wants to initiate a move by them-self, they will start from the settings of their Cozy. The two workflows are available. Starting from settings \u00b6 Starting from cozy-move \u00b6 Notes \u00b6 For security, we need an interaction of the user with both instances (even if the user is already logged). There is a confirmation mail sent by the source Cozy, that counts as a interaction. For the target Cozy, a click on a page served by the stack could have been enough, but asking the password was easier to explain to the user and improve the sense of security as perceived by the user, so that was what we did. And we had to take care of that to allow or forbid swapping instances on Cozy-Move. The token exchanges are inspired by OAuth 2.0, but don\u2019t follow OAuth 2.0 as it would have made the user experience really awkwards with lots of redirections and meaningless screens. The confirmation mail is really important, as it is a safeguard if the worflows are not as robust as we think they are. Source instance \u00b6 Exporting the data from a Cozy was a feature already implemented in the stack. The user can ask an export of their Cozy: the stack will send a mail with a link, and after following the link, the user can download the data as a zip. If the VFS ( Virtual File System ) takes a lot of space, the zip will be split in several parts. When an export if part of a move, the instance is blocked to avoid any change that could increase the risk of inconsistencies during the move. And, if the move is successful, the OAuth clients are revoked to encourage the user to reconnect them on the target. Also, the source instance will be destroyed 30 days later. It gives time to the user to check that every thing is OK on their new instance, and can be used to alert other users that want to see a page shared by link of the new address of the sharing. Zip vs Tar \u00b6 The export produces a zip file (or several files if it is too large). But the stack first makes a tar file while preparing the export. At first, it looks strange, but we though that a zip will be more friendly for users, and a tar is more adapted to our constraints. A tar can be read sequentially while a zip needs random access, and it was easier to stream a tar from Swift and converts it to zip, than trying to add entries to a zip file (and we didn\u2019t want to copy the whole files from the VFS in the zip in Swift as it takes too much space). Target instance \u00b6 Importing a zip can also be done before moving: the user can go in the settings of their Cozy, gives the URL of the zip, and let the Cozy imports it. The Cozy is reset before the import: the data is erased! We would like to offer a way to merge the existing data and the data to import, but it looks really complex and we think that it is more useful to use our time on other features. At the end of the import, a mail is sent to the user to tell them that they can use again their Cozy (the instance is blocked during the reset+import). Special doctypes \u00b6 Apps \u00b6 The home, settings, and store applications are always installed on the target Cozy. And we also try to install all the webapps and konnectors from the source, but it can fail as they might not be available (e.g. the 2 Cozys don\u2019t have the same apps registry). In that case, the user will be alerted in the mail sent at the end of the import. For the permissions, we recreate them from the manifest and don\u2019t try to import them from the source instance. Email address \u00b6 The email address on the target instance is kept. We don\u2019t import the email address the user had on their source instance. The stack also keep other settings that are tied to the cloudery (UUID, ToS, context). We also update the myself document with the kept email address. Files \u00b6 The directories, files, and versions are imported. The thumbnails are not exported/imported, but rebuilt on the target instance. If the quota of the target is too small for the files from the source, we alert the user before the move. Konnectors \u00b6 See the apps section. For konnectors that have a on_delete_accounts hook, we have to use some tricks: we delete the accounts on the target instance for the reset while the instance is blocked, but the konnectors can still make requests to the stack for those executions (allowed via a flag in redis) the accounts from the source instance are not imported on the target, as they will be useless soon (when they will be deleted by the source). Sessions \u00b6 They are not imported. Sharings \u00b6 For the shared by links, we import the permission document. But the link given to other users will still go on the old instance. While this instance is not deleted, it will show a page that gives the new link. For the Cozy to Cozy sharings, the stack has a mechanism for updating them so that the other instances will now synchronize with the target. It is a bit complicated as we have to make it work if several members of a sharing has moving at the same time, and as the JWT tokens are tied to an instance and have to be renewed (access token & refresh token). Triggers \u00b6 We import the triggers for the sharings and konnectors. For the apps (services), they are recreated when installed. The trigger for the thumbnails is also recreated when the instance is reset (not imported). Note: the triggers are imported at the end to avoid creating many jobs when importing the shared files. Vault \u00b6 The bitwarden vault is encrypted with a key not available on the servers (on purpose).

These notifications are part of a \u201cNotification Center\u201d where the user can configure the behavior of these notifications and the channel in which they are sent. Firebase configuration \u00b6 The push notifications can be sent via Firebase to smartphones. By default, the key used to connect to firebase is set in the configuration file, via the notifications.fcm_credentials_file parameter. But it can be useful to have several firebase accounts when there are several applications developed by several organizations. In that case, it is possible to tell the stack to use a particular key for a given app by creating a CouchDB document inside the secrets/io-cozy-account_types database, like this: { \"_id\" : \"myapp\" , \"slug\" : \"myapp\" , \"fcm_credentials\" : { \"type\" : \"service_account\" , \"etc.\" : \"...\" } } And we can go further to restrict this to a context, by prefixing the _id with the context name and / : { \"_id\" : \"mycontext/myapp\" , \"slug\" : \"myapp\" , \"fcm_credentials\" : { \"type\" : \"service_account\" , \"etc.\" : \"...\" } } Declare application\u2019s notifications \u00b6 Each application have to declare in its manifest the notifications it needs to send.

For instance, a account-balance quota for a user\u2019s bank account: such notification is only useful as its last value. stateful (boolean): defines a notification storing a piece of state: for each new notification, the stack will check that if the last sent notification has a different state before sending it. If not, the notification will not be resent multiple (boolean): specify the possibility for a notification to have different sub-categories, defined by a programmable/dynamic identifier. collapsible and stateful properties are inherited for each sub- categories. default_priority : default priority to use, with values \u201chigh\u201d or \u201cnormal\u201d. This is propagated to the underlying mobile notifications system. templates : a link list to templates file contained in the application folder that can be used to write the content of the notification, depending on the communication channel.

It allows to let the owner of the cozy instance controls the access to her data, files and actions on them. The permissions are given in several contexts. Let\u2019s see them! Client-side apps \u00b6 When the user installs a new client-side app, she is asked to accept an initial set of permissions for this app. This set of permissions is described in the manifest of the app. Later, the application can gain more permissions via the intents and optional permissions. See below for more details. When the authentified user access a client-side app, the app receives a token from the stack that can be used in later requests to the stack as a proof of the permissions it owns. External apps via OAuth2 \u00b6 An external application can ask for permissions via the OAuth2 dance, and use them later with the access token. The permissions are in the scope parameter. Sharing with other users \u00b6 The owner of a cozy instance can share some documents and files with other users. It can be done in two ways: If the other user also has a cozy, it can be a cozy-to-cozy sharing. Else, the owner can give to him a link with a code or a shortcode. What is a permission? \u00b6 A permission gives the right for a request having it to do something on the stack. It is defined by four components. Type \u00b6 type is the attribute used in JSON-API or the doctype for the Data System. It is the only mandatory component. If just the type is specified, it gives access to all the operations on this type . For example, a permission on type io.cozy.contacts gives the right to create, read, update and delete any contact, and to fetch all the contacts. A permission on type io.cozy.files allow to access and modify any file or directory. Some known types: io.cozy.files , for files and folder in the VFS io.cozy.apps , for apps io.cozy.settings , for the settings io.cozy.jobs and io.cozy.triggers , for jobs io.cozy.oauth.clients , to list and revoke OAuth 2 clients It is also possible to use a wildcard to use a doctype and its sub-doctypes if the doctype contains at least 3 . . For example, io.cozy.bank.* will give access to io.cozy.bank , io.cozy.bank.accounts , io.cozy.bank.accounts.stats , io.cozy.bank.settings , etc. io.cozy.* will give you an error. Verbs \u00b6 It says which HTTP verbs can be used for requests to the cozy-stack. GET will give read-only access, DELETE can be used for deletions, etc. Verbs should be declared in a list, like [\"GET\", \"POST\", \"DELETE\"] , and use [\"ALL\"] as a shortcut for [\"GET\", \"POST\", \"PUT\", \"PATCH\", \"DELETE\"] (it is the default). Note : HEAD is implicitely implied when GET is allowed. OPTIONS for Cross-Origin Resources Sharing is always allowed, the stack does not have the informations about the permission when it answers the request. Values \u00b6 It\u2019s possible to restrict the permissions to only some documents of a doctype, or to just some files and folders. You can give a list of ids in values . Note : a permission for a folder also gives permissions with same verbs for files and folders inside it. Selector \u00b6 By default, the values are checked with the id . But it\u2019s possible to use a selector to filter on another field . In particular, it can be used for sharing. A user may share a calendar and all the events inside it. It will be done with two permissions. The first one is for the calendar: { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.calendars\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"GET\" ], \"values\" : [ \"1355812c-d41e-11e6-8467-53be4648e3ad\" ] } And the other is for the events inside the calendar: { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.events\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"GET\" ], \"selector\" : \"calendar-id\" , \"values\" : [ \"1355812c-d41e-11e6-8467-53be4648e3ad\" ] } What format for a permission? \u00b6 JSON \u00b6 The prefered format for permissions is JSON. Each permission is a map with the type , verbs , values and selector see above, plus a description that can be used to give more informations to the user. Only the type field is mandatory. In the manifest, the permissions are regrouped in a map. The key is not very relevant, it\u2019s just here for localization. The same key is used in the locales field to identify the permission. Example: { \"permissions\" : { \"contacts\" : { \"description\" : \"Required for autocompletion on @name\" , \"type\" : \"io.cozy.contacts\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"GET\" ] }, \"images\" : { \"description\" : \"Required for the background\" , \"type\" : \"io.cozy.files\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"GET\" , \"POST\" ], \"values\" : [ \"io.cozy.files.music-dir\" ] }, \"mail\" : { \"description\" : \"Required to send a congratulations email to your friends\" , \"type\" : \"io.cozy.jobs\" , \"selector\" : \"worker\" , \"values\" : [ \"sendmail\" ] } } } Inline \u00b6 OAuth2 as a scope parameter for defining the permissions given to the application. But it\u2019s only a string, not a JSON. In that case, we use a space delimited list of permissions, each permission is written compactly with : between the components. Example: io.cozy.contacts io.cozy.files:GET:io.cozy.files.music-dir io.cozy.jobs:POST:sendmail:worker Note : the verbs component can\u2019t be omitted when the values and selector are used.

It can also associates one or more codes to it, via the codes parameter in the query string. These codes can then be sent to other people as a way to give these permissions (sharing by links). For each code created, a corresponding shortcode is generated and can be used to shorten links for sharing. The codes parameter is a comma separed list of values. The role of these values is to identify the codes if you want to revoke some of them later. A ttl parameter can also be given to make the codes expires after a delay ( bigduration format ). If the ttl does not exceed 1 hour, it is possible to add a tinycode=true parameter to the query-string to have a shortcode of 6 digits. Note : it is only possible to create a strict subset of the permissions associated to the sent token.

If it is the case, it may offer to the user two choices: update the file with the new version (the albums and playlists will use the new version) save the new version as a new file and preserve the old file (the old file may be moved to a originals directory). Moving a referenced file to the trash \u00b6 Before an application moves a file to the trash, if the file has some references, it should ask the user if they really want to trash the file. And it should also removes the references before trashing the file. Implementation \u00b6 The references are persisted in the io.cozy.files documents in CouchDB. A mango index is used to fetch all the files that are associated to a given document (for GET /data/:type/:doc-id/relationships/references ). For request to update or move to trash a file, it is easy to fetch its CouchDB document to see if it has a reference. But it is more difficult when moving a folder to trash. To do that, we need two requests to fetch the number of references in a folder. 1/ Get all descendant folders from a given folder, with a CouchDB View: map = function ( doc ) { if ( doc . type === \"folder\" ) emit ( doc . path ); }; query = { startkey : parent_folder_path + \"/\" , endkey : parent_folder_path + \"/\\uFFFF\" }; 2/ Get the total number of \u201creferenced\u201d file for this folders list, with a map/reduce CouchDB view: map = function ( doc ) { if ( doc . referenced != null ) emit ( doc . parentID ) } reduce = count query = { keys : [ list from above ]}", "title": " /files - References of documents in VFS"}, {"location": "cozy-stack/references-docs-in-vfs/#references-of-documents-in-the-virtual-file-system", "text": "", "title": "References of documents in the Virtual File System"}, {"location": "cozy-stack/references-docs-in-vfs/#what-we-want", "text": "Cozy applications can use data from the Data System and files from the Virtual File System.

The applications metadata are stored and versioned. It can be used by a cozy to list applications to be installed, and for auto-updating the applications. We define the applications registry as an API. This should allow us to defer the real implementation of the registry storage and allow different store implementations. The stack itself implement the querying part of the registry API , proxying the request to the registries attached to the instance . Publishing on our official registries \u00b6 In order for you to publish on our official registries, please follow this howto describing how to obtain a token and parameter you repository to automatically publish versions. Channels \u00b6 We differentiate three channels of release for each application: stable: for stable releases beta: for application that can be tested in advance dev: for the latest releases directly from the trunk of the repository For each of these channels, the version string has a different format which differentiate the version channel: stable: X.Y.Z where X , Y and Z are positive or null integers. beta: X.Y.Z-beta.M where X , Y , Z and M are positive or null integers dev: X.Y.Z-dev.checksum where X , Y and Z are positive or null integers and checksum is a unique identifier of the dev release (typically a shasum of the git commit) Version order \u00b6 TLDR: 1.0.0-dev._ < 1.0.0 and 1.0.0-beta._ < 1.0.0 , make sure you upgrade your app version after publishing stable. The order used to determine the latest version of a channel is the following: - `1.0.0-dev.* < 1.0.0 (dev < stable)` - `1.0.0-beta.* < 1.0.0 (beta < stable)` - `1.0.0-beta.1 < 1.0.0-beta.2` To order beta and dev releases, we apply a sort by their creation date. Objects \u00b6 Two types of objects are managed in the registry: applications and versions. Application \u00b6 An application described a specific package. It is linked to multiple versions (releases) of the application. An application object is mutable . An application object contains the following fields: slug : the application slug (unique) type : the application type (\u201cwebapp\u201d or \u201ckonnector\u201d) editor : the application editor name versions : an object containing all the channels versions latest_version : the latest available version maintenance_activated : boolean, true when the maintenance mode is activated on the application maintenance_options : present only if maintenance_activated is true, object with the following fields: flag_infra_maintenance : bool, true iff the maintenance is internal to the cozy infrastructure flag_short_maintenance : bool, true iff the maintenance is a short maintenance, waiting for a correction on our side flag_disallow_manual_exec : bool, true iff the maintenance will disallow the execution on the application, even when manually executed messages : a list of localized messages containing a short and long information messages explaining the maintenance state label : integer for a confidence grade from 0 to 5 (A to F), labelling the application from a user privacy standpoint. It is calculated from the data_usage_commitment and data_usage_commitment_by fields. data_usage_commitment : specify a technical commitment from the application editor: user_ciphered : technical commitment that the user\u2019s data is encrypted and can only be known by him. user_reserved : commitment that the data is only used for the user, to directly offer its service. none : no commitment data_usage_commitment_by : specify what entity is taking the commitment: cozy : the commitment is taken by cozy editor : the commitment is taken by the application\u2019s editor none : no commitment is taken Example: { \"slug\" : \"drive\" , \"type\" : \"webapp\" , \"editor\" : \"cozy\" , \"versions\" : { \"stable\" : [ \"3.1.1\" ], \"beta\" : [ \"3.1.1-beta.1\" ], \"dev\" : [ \"3.1.1-dev.7a8354f74b50d7beead7719252a18ed45f55d070\" ] }, \"latest_version\" : { /* */ } } Version \u00b6 A version object describe a specific release of an application. A version object is immutable . An application version object contains the following fields: slug : the application slug type : the application type (webapp, konnector, \u2026) manifest : the entire manifest defined in the package created_at : date of the release creation url : URL of the tarball containing the application at specified version size : the size of the application package (uncompressed) in bytes as string sha256 : the sha256 checksum of the application content tar_prefix : optional tar prefix directory specified to properly extract the application content The version string should follow the channels rule.

This namespace can contain a list of URL for the different registries attached to the stack. The stack itself implements the querying API of a registry. When querying this API, to ask for an application, the stack uses this hierarchy of registries to proxy or redirect the user. The hierarchy can also be contextualised to specify different registries to different contexts. The default context is applied lastly. Examples: \u00b6 registries : - https://myregistry.home/ - https://main.registry.cozy.io/ # In this example, a \"context1\" instance will have the equivalent of the # following list of registries: # # - https://context1.registry.cozy.io/ # - https://myregistry.home/ # - https://registry.cozy.io/ # registries : context1 : - https://context1.registry.cozy.io/ context2 : - https://context2.registry.cozy.io/ default : - https://myregistry.home/ - https://registry.cozy.io/ Authentication \u00b6 The authentication is based on a token that allow you to publish applications and versions with for one specific editor name.

Our proposal is to make client side apps able to query external websites of their choices, but these requests will be made via the cozy-stack (as a proxy) and will be logged to check later that no personal data was leaked unintentionally. We can see the data loaded from the external website as a document with a doctype: it\u2019s just not a doctype local to our cozy, but a remote one. A client side app can request data from external websites by doing these three steps: Declaring a remote doctype and its requests Declaring permissions on these doctypes in the manifest Calling the /remote API of cozy-stack Declaring a remote doctype \u00b6 Doctypes are formalized in this repository: github.com/cozy/cozy-doctypes . Each doctype has its own directory inside the repository. For a remote doctype, it will include a file called request that will describe how the cozy-stack will request the external website.

Each one has a request defined for it. The format for the request file is: the verb and the URL on the first line then some lines that describe the HTTP headers then a blank line and the body if the request is a POST The URL can only use the default port. But, for development and testing in local, this rule can be disabled with the --remote-allow-custom-port flag of the cozy-stack serve command. For the path, the query-string, the headers, and the body, it\u2019s possible to have some dynamic part by using {{ , a variable name, and }} . Some templating helpers are available to escape specific variables using {{ function name - space - variable name }} . These helpers are only available for the body part of the template. Available helpers: json : for json parts ( { \"key\": \"{{json val}}\" } ) html : for html parts ( <p>{{html val}}</p> ) query : for query parameter of a url ( http://foobar.com?q={{query q}} ) path : for path component of a url ( http://foobar.com/{{path p}} ) Values injected in the URL are automatically URI-escaped based on the part they are included in: namely as a query parameter or as a path component. Note : by default, the User-Agent is set to a default value (\u201ccozy-stack\u201d and a version number). It can be overriden in the request description. Example: GET https://foobar.com/ {{ path }} ?q= {{ query }} Content-Type: {{ contentType }} { \"key\": \" {{ json value }} \", \"url\": \"http://anotherurl.com/ {{ path anotherPath }} ?q= {{ query anotherQuery }} \", } Declaring permissions \u00b6 Nothing special here.

It can use the query-string for GET, and a JSON body for POST, to give values for the variables. Example: GET /remote/org.wikidata.search?q=Douglas+Adams HTTP / 1.1 Host : alice.cozy.localhost It is possible to send some extra informations, to make it easier to understand the request. If no variable in the request matches it, it won\u2019t be send to the remote website.

Secrets \u00b6 It is possible to make the stack inject a secret in a request. For example, if we want to make the stack inject a token for the request, then: 1- We need to store the secret in CouchDB, in the secrets/io-cozy-remote-secrets database. The document must have the remote doctype as an id, and the secret in another field, like this: { \"_id\" : \"cc.cozycloud.foobar\" , \"token\" : \"1c7f3ba03bd801391a91543d7eb8149c\" } 2- Use this secret in the remote doctype declaration: GET https://foobar.com/baz/ HTTP / 1.1 Authorization : Bearer {{secret_token}} You can see that we store token in the io-cozy-remote-secret but we use secret_token in the remote doctype declaration, this is a convention to follow.

Engineers have a tendancy to overestimate the technical risks and underestimate the human interactions. It doesn\u2019t mean that we can avoid technical measures. But it\u2019s very important to take in account the possible behaviour of the user. That means that adding a text to explain him/her the consequences of a click on a button can increase the security a lot much than forcing him/her to do things. For example, forcing users to change regulary their password makes them choose passwords that are a lot weaker (but easier for them to remember). Defense in depth is still worthy \u00b6 Also known as layered defense, defense in depth is a security principle where single points of complete compromise are eliminated or mitigated by the incorporation of a series or multiple layers of security safeguards and risk-mitigation countermeasures. Have diverse defensive strategies, so that if one layer of defense turns out to be inadequate, another layer of defense will hopefully prevent a full breach. Have a strict control of all the accesses to the Cozy \u00b6 All the requests to the cozy stack have a strict access control. It is based on several informations: Is the user connected? What is the application that makes this request? What are the permissions for this application? Which grant is used, in particular for applications with public pages? What are the permissions for this grant? More informations here . Protect client-side apps by default \u00b6 This is mostly applying the state of the art: Using HTTPS, with HSTS. Using secure, httpOnly, sameSite cookies to avoid cookies theft or misuse. Using a Content Security Policy (CSP). Using X-frame-options http header to protect against click-jacking. But we will use a CSP very restrictive by default (no access to other web domains for example). Don\u2019t trust inputs, always sanitize them \u00b6 If we take the OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities , we can see that a lot of them are related to trusting inputs. It starts with the first one, injections, but it goes also to XSS and unvalidated forwards (in OAuth2 notably). Always sanitizing inputs is a good pratice that improves security, but has also some nice effects like helping developers discover hidden bugs. Encryption is not the solution to all the problems, but it helps \u00b6 Some data are encrypted before being saved in CouchDB (passwords for the accounts for example). Encrypting everything has some downsides: It\u2019s not possible to index encryped documents or do computations on the encrypted fields in reasonable time ( homomorphic encryption is still an open subject). Having more encrypted data can globally weaken the encryption, if it\u2019s not handled properly. If the encryption key is lost or a bug happen, the data is lost with no way to recover them. So, we are more confortable to encrypt only some fields. And later, when we will have more experience and feedbacks from the user, extend the encryption to more fields. We are also working with SMIS , a research lab, to find a way to securely store and backup the encryption keys. Use standards (https, OAuth2) \u00b6 Standards like https and OAuth2 had a lot of eyes to look at them, and are therefore more robust. Reinventing the wheel can be valuable for some things. But for security, the cost is very high and only some very particular constraints can justify such an high cost. Cozy don\u2019t have these constraints, so we will stick to the standards. Have a reliable way to deploy, with sane defaults \u00b6 It\u2019s important that deploying a cozy is well documented, doesn\u2019t require too many steps and can be automatized. An error on the installation can have dramatic effects, like the database being leaked on internet. So, we need to really take care of the devops experience. In particular, having sane defaults for the configuration will help to minimize the number of things he/she has to do, and such the number of places where he/she can make faux pas.

For users with two-factor authentication activated, a second step on the same route is necessary to actually update the passphrase. See below. A \"force\": true parameter can be added in the JSON to force a passphrase on a Cozy where authentication by password is disabled and the vault is empty. It allows to use Cozy Pass when the authentication on the Cozy is delegated via OIDC. When forcing a password reset, you need to regenerate the public and private keys encryption key of the vault and pass them via key , publicKey and privateKey . See those password-helpers for example on how to regenerate those keys.

PUT /settings/instance/auth_mode \u00b6 With this route, the user can ask for the activation of different authentication modes, like two-factor authentication. Available authentication modes: basic : basic authentication only with passphrase two_factor_mail : authentication with passphrase and validation with a code sent via email to the user. When asking for activation of the two-factor authentication, a side-effect can be triggered to send the user its code (via email for instance), and the activation not being effective. This side-effect should provide the user with a code that can be used to finalize the activation of the two-factor authentication. Hence, this route has two behaviors: the code is not provided: the route is a side effect to ask for the activation of 2FA, and a code is sent the code is provided, and valid: the two-factor authentication is actually activated. Status codes: 204 No Content : when the mail has been confirmed and two-factor authentication is activated 422 Unprocessable Entity : when the given confirmation code is not good.

Feature flags \u00b6 A feature flag is a name and an associated value (boolean, number, string or a JSON) that can be interpreted by the apps. It can be used for giving access to paid features, or to enable a feature progressively on all the cozy instances of a context. The stack computes the feature flags from several sources (in order of decreasing priority): the flags set on the instance by the command cozy-stack feature flags the response of the manager for GET /api/v1/flags?sets=s1,s2&context=ctx (where s1,s2 has been set via cozy-stack feature sets ) the flags coming from the context configuration ( context.<name>.features ) the flags set on the context by the command cozy-stack feature ratio the default value ( cozy-stack feature default ). For a given flag, the stack takes the value from the source with the highest priority, and does not look at the other sources (no merge).

Data sync \u00b6 The shared data is duplicated among members: it is both on the sharer\u2019s cozy (the owner), and on the recipients\u2019 cozy. This is a core difference compared to a federated sharing such as the one in NextCloud . The CouchDB replication protocol is used to synchronize the documents. It means that the documents will be same on the owner side and on the recipients side (\u201csymmetric sharing\u201d). The applications say what is shared, the cozy stack synchronizes that. The stack does the low-level work and gives primitives to the applications. The applications must use them in a responsible manner, and in particular, to avoid transitivity issues. The applications should know how to deal with documents\u2019 conflicts, e.g. what to do with a document updated by several members at the same time with different content. At least, the default CouchDB behaviour to handle conflicts and select winning revisions should be acceptable if the applications don\u2019t do anything to detect and resolve conflicts. Contacts discovery \u00b6 A sharer may not know the addresses of the recipients\u2019 cozy instances, but he/she has a way to send them an URL on his/her cozy to start the process. Recipient preview \u00b6 A recipient can preview a sharing before accepting it if the application supports this option. Else, he/she will have only the description and rules to make his/her mind about accepting or refusing the sharing. Specific data type support \u00b6 For files and folders, the documents replication process (the replicator) is customized to handle the specificities of the io.cozy.files doctype. The applications must be able to work with broken relationships between documents, which can happen if one shares a document without its relationships. Safety principles \u00b6 First safety principle : when a user B accepts a sharing from user A, the documents that were on the user B\u2019s cozy before the sharing are not sent to user A without an explicit action of user B (like moving a file to a shared directory). Second safety principle : when two users, A and B, are sharing documents, a change of a document on the user A\u2019s cozy can\u2019t make an exiting document of user B enter in the sharing. Setup of a sharing \u00b6 Step 1: the owner creates the sharing \u00b6 One person decides to share something with other people from an application on her cozy. In our example, Alice wants to share a todo list with her friends, Bob and Charlie, and it is done from the Todo application. The application calls the stack with the rules for this sharing, including the documents to target and the rights granted to the recipients, to add/update/delete todos. It also specifies the contacts with whom to share by providing their identifiers. See the sharing schema for a complete description of the expected fields. The stack persists an io.cozy.sharings document and sends an email to the recipients (Bob an Charlie). Step 2: a recipient accepts the sharing \u00b6 A recipient, let\u2019s say Bob, receives the email and clicks on the link. His browser shows him the Todo application on Alice\u2019s Cozy so that he can preview the todo list, and a modal asks him if he wants to continue the sharing acceptation workflow. If he does, a form will ask him what is the address of his Cozy (the form can be pre-filled if he has already accepted another sharing in the past). After he has filled the form and submitted it, he is redirected on his Cozy. If he is not logged in, he has to login first. Then, a page describes him how the sharing will work and what technical permissions it implies. It also asks him to confirm the sharing. If he accepts, his instance will send to Alice\u2019s instance the answer. Step 3: the initial replication starts \u00b6 Alice\u2019s Cozy instance creates some tokens and sends them with other informations such as the response of the answer request from Bob\u2019s instance. At this moment, both instances are ready to start to replicate data to the other instances. So, let\u2019s do the initial replication. Alice\u2019s instance starts to fill the io.cozy.shared database with all the documents that match a rule of the sharing (except the rules with local: true ), and create triggers for the future documents to be also added in this database (the exact triggers depend of the parameters of the rules). And, when done, it creates a job for the replicator, and setups a trigger for future changes in the io.cozy.shared to start a replicator job. This mechanism is further explained in the data sync section. Bob\u2019s instance also checks if any document matches a sharing rule. In most cases, it won\u2019t. But in some very special cases (e.g. a previous revoked sharing on the same documents), there are some documents that match a rule. They are added to the io.cozy.shared database, but with a conflict flag. They won\u2019t be replicated unless Bob accepts to in his Todo application. Triggers are also added on Bob\u2019s instance for filling the io.cozy.shared database, and to call the replicator after that. Note: there is a lock around the initial filling of the io.cozy.shared database to avoid concurrency issues if two recipients accept the sharing at the same time. Data sync \u00b6 As stated in the baseline, the shared data is copied among the databases of all the members for a sharing. Therefore, contrarily to centralized or federated sharing, where the same data is accessed by all members, extra work must be done to replicate changes between all members. The replication mode is specified in a sharing rule for each document action: add, update or delete. It can be: none : the changes won\u2019t be replicated between members. push : only the changes made by the owner will be propaged to the recipients. sync : the changes made by any member are propagated to the other members. See the sharing schema for more details and examples. The data synchronization is based on the document\u2019s revisions. Each time a document is updated in database, a new revision is created with the following format: 1-abc , where 1 is a number incremented at each new change and abc a hash of the document. The revisions history of each shared document is saved in a io.cozy.shared document. This history is used to compare revisions between sharing members and propagate updates. Hence, not only the shared documents are synced, but also their whole revisions history through the io.cozy.shared database. See the revisions syncing section for a complete example. General workflow \u00b6 In the following, we assume the a sync sharing for all actions between Alice, Bob and Charlie. Step 1: a todo item is added on Bob\u2019s Cozy, a trigger is fired and it adds the new document to the io.cozy.shared database Step 2: a debounced trigger on the io.cozy.shared database is used to start a replicator Step 3: the replicator does the following steps it queries a local document of the io.cozy.shared database to get the last sequence number of a successful replication with this sequence number, it requests the changes feed of io.cozy.shared with a filter on the sharing id the results is a list of document doctype + id + rev that is sent to Alice\u2019s Cozy Alice\u2019s Cozy checks which revisions are known, and send a response with the list of those that are not for each not known revision, Bob\u2019s Cozy send the document to Alice\u2019s Cozy (in bulk) and, if it\u2019s all good, it persists the new sequence number in the local document, as a start point for the next replication Step 4: the changes are put in the io.cozy.shared database on Alice\u2019s Cozy Step 5: it starts a replicator on Alice\u2019s Cozy Step 6: the replicator send the changes to Charlie\u2019s Cozy, all the cozy instances are synchronized again! Note: when a todo item is moved fron a shared todo list to a not shared todo list, the document in io.cozy.shared for the todo item is kept, and the sharing id is associated to the keyword removed inside it. The remove behavior of the sharing rule is then applied. Revisions syncing \u00b6 Here, we detail the internals of the revisions-based syncing mechanism through an example: Alice, Bob and Charlie share a Todo with the id \u201ctodo1\u201d. Note that in reality this id would be an UUID, but we give it a simple name for the sake of clarity. This Todo had only one update (its creation), made by Alice that generated the revision 1-a . After the initial replication, all the members have a io.cozy.shared document, with this sole revision as history. This history is actually a tree: when a CouchDB conflict occurs, a new branch is created, containing the losing revision, so we can keep track of it and avoid losing any data. Note the document id is in the form <doctype>/<docid> to easily reference the shared document. Here, it is io.cozy.todos/todo1 . In the sequence diagram below, we illustrate the steps occuring when Alice generates updates. We also illustrate how a CouchDB can occur and how it is handled, by making Charlie updating the same document than Alice at the same time. This update leads to a conflict between the revisions 2-a , generated by Alice, and 2-c , generated by Charlie: a winning revision is then elected by CouchDB, 2-a , but 2-c is saved in another branch of the revision tree. Thanks to it, the conflict is propagated to other members that will be able to resolve it through the Todo application (by manually erasing or merging the conflicted revision for instance). Eventually, all members converge to the same state with the same docs and the same revisions histories. CouchDB conflicts \u00b6 A CouchDB conflict is when a document has conflicting revisions, i.e. it has at least two revisions branches in its revision history. Hence, these conflicts are made on the database level. By design , CouchDB can produce conflicts in its replication protocol, as the revision history is replicated and forced among nodes. We detail here how a CouchDB conflict can be made. In the particular case of files and folders, we implemented specific strategies to avoid having to deal with conflicts at the application level: the stack is able to prevent CouchDB conflicts for io.cozy.files documents and enforce reconciliation when possible. We also detail what is done when no reconciliation can be made. Id transformations \u00b6 Initially, we were using the CouchDB protocol revision as described above, but we have introduced a transformation of the identifiers for io.cozy.files, and later, we have generalized this transformation for all doctypes. It means that Alice and Bob have the same shared documents, but not with the same identifiers. The identifiers are transformed with a XOR, using a key exchanged when the recipient accepts the sharing. In practice, it is useful when someone is revoked from a sharing, and accepts later the sharing again. It allows to avoid reusing the same identifiers for documents exchanged on the first sharing and on the second sharing, which can create some weird situations. For example, a cipher is shared between Alice and Bob when its revision is 3-aaa. Later, when the sharing is revoked, the document will be deleted on Bob\u2019s instance (the ciphers are deleted on recipients when a sharing is revoked), which creates a revision 4-bbb. If Alice invites Bob again, and Bob accepts, the replication will sent the document from Alice\u2019s instance to Bob\u2019s instance with revision 3-aaa. CouchDB will say OK, but the revision 4-bbb will still be seen as a successor of 3-aaa, and for CouchDB, the document will still be deleted. Using different IDs for the first and second sharing fixes this issue. Files and folders \u00b6 Why are they special? \u00b6 Files are special for several reasons. First and foremost, they have a binary attached to them that can be quite heavy. The stack also enforces some rules on them (e.g. a file can\u2019t be added to a deleted folder) and has some specific code for the tree nature of files and folders (e.g. a permission on a folder is inherited on all the files and folders inside it, even if they are several levels below). Thus, the workflow explained just before is not compatible with the files. As we need to introduce some code specific to the files, we have also wanted to improve the sharing of files. First, we don\u2019t want to force the recipients to put the shared folder at exactly the same place as the owner. In fact, we think that putting the shared folder in a folder called Shared with me is more friendly. We also think that a file that has been shared in the past but is no longer (the sharing has been revoked) can evolve on both the owner\u2019s cozy and on the recipients\u2019 cozy in different ways, and in such a case, it\u2019s more logical to consider them as different files. These two reasons implies, on a technical level, that the identifiers for files and folders are not the same on the owner and the recipients of a sharing. The replicator will translate the identifiers from one system to another during the replications. Of course, it will also translate the id in the sharing rules, and the dir_id to preserve the relationship between a file and its parent folder. The path attribute will be seen as a cache, and recomputed when a cozy instance receives a folder document from a sharing replication. We will continue to have a replication as close to the CouchDB replication as possible. It means we synchronize a state, and not looking for the history of operations like cozy-desktop does. It is less accurate and can lead more often to conflicts. The cozy instances are expected to be online most of the time and have a short delay for replications: we think that the conflicts will happen only on rares occasions. This make acceptable to take this shortcut. And, in case of conflicts, we will preserve the content of the files (no data loss), even if it means duplicating the files. How a sharing involving files works? \u00b6 When a sharing involves a rule on the io.cozy.files doctype, a folder is created on the recipients cozy where the files will be put. It is created inside the Shared with me folder by default, but can be moved somewhere else after that. The folder won\u2019t be synchronized its-self later, and if the folder is trashed, the sharing is automatically revoked. As it is not a reversible action, a confirmation is asked before doing that. Note: we will forbid the sharing of the root of the virtual file system, of the trash and trashed files/folders, and of course the Shared with me folder. The step 3 described above, aka the replicator, will be more complicated for folders and files. First change, it will work on two phases: 1. what can be synchronized without transfering the binaries first, and 2. the synchronization of files with a binary attached. Second change, the replicator will acquire the Virtual File System lock on the cozy instance where it will write things to ensure the consistency of what it writes. Third change, before inserting a folder or file in the database, the replicator checks that its parent exists, and if it\u2019s not the case, it creates it. Last change, we will avoid CouchDB conflicts for files and folder by using a special conflict resolution process. Sequence diagram \u00b6 Conflict resolution \u00b6 In the case of io.cozy.files documents, we prevent CouchDB conflicts to happen by implementing specific strategies. Here, we detail the conflicts situations where a resolution is possible: When two cozy instances have modified the same file concurrently Same for a folder When two files or folders are renamed concurrently to the same name inside the same directory When a file or folder is created or updated on cozy instance while the parent directory is trashed concurrently on another cozy instance. For 1. and 2., we will reconciliate the changes except for a file with two versions having a distinct binary (we rely on size and checksum to detect that). In such a case, we create a copy of the file with one version, while keeping the other version in the original file (the higher revision wins). For 3., we say that the owner instance wins: the file with the name in conflict on the owner instance will keep its name, and the other file with the same name will be renamed. This rule helps to minimize the number of exchanges between the cozy instances, which is a factor of stability to avoid more conflicts. For 4., we restore the trashed parent, or recreate it if it the trash was emptied. Conflict with no reconciliation \u00b6 When a file is modified concurrently on two cozy instances, and at least one change involve the content, we can\u2019t reconciliate the modifications. To know which version of the file is the \u201cwinner\u201d and will keep the same identifier, and which version is the \u201closer\u201d and will have a new identifier, we compare the revisions and the higher wins. This conflict is particulary tricky to resolve, with a lot of subcases. In particular, we try to converge to the same revisions on all the instances for the \u201cwinner\u201d file (and for the \u201closer\u201d too). We have 3 sets of attributes for files: size and md5sum (they change when the content has changed) name and dir_id (they change when the file is moved or renamed) created_at , updated_at , tags , referenced_by , etc. For the first two sets, the operation on the Virtual File System will needs to reach the storage (Swift), not just CouchDB. For the third set, it\u2019s easy: we can do the change at the same time as another change, because these attributes are only used in CouchDB. But we can\u2019t do a change on the first two sets at the same time: the Virtual File System can\u2019t update the content and move/rename a file in the same operation. If we needs to do both, it will generate 2 revisions in CouchDB for the file. Note: you can see that using CouchDB-like replication protocol means that we have some replications that can look useless, just some echo to a writing. In fact, it is used to acknowledge the writing and is helpful for conflict resolutions. It may be conter-intuitive, but removing them will harm the stability of the system, even if they do nothing most of the time. Example 1 \u00b6 Here, Alice uploads a file on her Cozy. It creates two revisions for this file (it\u2019s what the Virtual File System does). Then, she shares the directory with this file to her friend Bob. When Bob accepts the sharing, the file is sent to his Cozy, with the same revision (2-2aa). Later, Bob renames the file. It creates a new revision (3-3aa). The change is replicated to Alice\u2019s Cozy. And we have a replication from Alice to Bob to ensure that every thing is fine. Even later, Alice and Bob both renames the file at the same time. It creates a conflict. We have a first replication (from Alice to Bob), but nothing happens on B because the local revision (4-4bb) is greater than the candidate revision (4-4aa) and the content is the same. Just after that, we have a revision on the opposite direction (from Bob to Alice). The candidate revision wins (4-4bb), but for files, we don\u2019t use CouchDB conflict, thus it\u2019s not possible to write a new revision at the same generation (4). The only option is to create a new revision (5-5bb). This revision is then sent to Bob: Bob\u2019s Cozy accepts the new revision even if it has no effect on the file (it was already the good name), just to resolve the conflict. Example 2 \u00b6 Like in the last example, Alice uploads a file and share a directory to Bob with this file, Bob acccepts. But then, several actions are made on the file in a short lapse of time and it generates a difficult conflict: Alice renames the file, and then uploads a new version with cozy-desktop Bob moves the file to a sub-directory. So, when the replication comes, we have two versions of the file with different name, parent directory, and content. The winner is the higher revision (4-4aa). The resolution takes 4 steps: A copy of the file is created from the revision 3-3bb, with the new identifier id2 = XorID(id, 3-3bb). The new content is written on Bob\u2019s Cozy: we can\u2019t use the revisions 3-3aa (same generation as 3-3bb) and 4-4aa (it will mean the conflict is fixed, but it\u2019s not the case, the filenames are still different), so a new revision is used (4-4cc). The file is moved and renamed on Bob\u2019s Cozy, with a next revision (5-5bb). The two files are sent to Alice\u2019s Cozy: 5-5bb is accepted just to resolve the conflict, and id2 is uploaded as a new file. Special case: out and in again \u00b6 Let\u2019s look at a special case. Alice shares a folder with Bob and Charlie. It contains a directory, with a few files inside it. This directory has been synchronized, and Bob decides to move it somewhere else on its cozy instance that is not inside the shared folder, let\u2019s say at the root. The sharing synchronization will move the directory to the trash for Alice and Charlie. Bob can continue to work on the files in this directory. If Charlie restores the directory from the trash, it will be put again in the sharing. And we can see that we have an issue: on Bob instance, we will have two copies on the files, at two different locations, but technically, they should have the same identifiers. It is not possible. To avoid that, we have to change the identifier, or more precisely, delete a file and recreate it with a new identifier. It means losing historical versions and some other things like sharing by links. It is an operation that takes a lot of resources. So, we need to be careful in how we do that. And, like usual for the sharing, we need to take care of the stability and convergence of the replication algorithm. With these constraints, the approache we have chosen is to put a copy of a file that was moved out of the sharing in the trash when this operation is replicated. For the member of the sharing that has made the operation, the file will be the same (no need to change how the VFS work), and it is only later, when this change is replicated to the other members that we will put a copy of the file in the trash and delete the file (this is managed by the sharing layer). Thus, the other members of the sharing will have a copy of the file, but not the original file (sharing by links won\u2019t work on the copy for example), and the old versions of the file will be lost. We think it is an acceptable tradeoff between complexity, reliability, and matching the user expectations. Still, it has an important limitation. If Alice and Bob moves a file from the shared directory to somewhere else at the same time, and later, one of them is moving again the file inside the shared directory, we will be in a bad situation, where the replication algorithm can\u2019t synchronize the file. For the moment, we prefer to advance with this limitation, but we will have to take care of it later. Schema \u00b6 Description of a sharing \u00b6 An identifier (the same for all members of the sharing) A list of members . The first one is the owner. For each member, we have: status , a status that can be: owner for the member that has created the sharing mail-not-sent for a member that has been added, but its invitation has not yet been sent (often, this status is used only for a few seconds) pending for a member with an invitation sent, but who has not clicked on the link seen for a member that has clicked on the invitation link, but has not setup the Cozy to Cozy replication for the sharing ready for a member where the Cozy to Cozy replication has been set up revoked for a member who is on longer in the sharing name , a contact name public_name , a public name email , the email address instance , the URL of the Cozy read_only , a flag to tell if the contact is restricted to read-only mode only_in_groups , a flag that will be false if the member has been added as a single contact groups , a list of indexes of the groups A list of groups , with for each one: id , the identifier of the io.cozy.contacts.groups name , the name of the group addedBy , the index of the member that has added the group read_only , a flag to tell if the group is restricted to read-only mode revoked , a flag set to true when the group is revoked from the sharing Some credentials to authorize the transfer of data between the owner and the recipients A description (one sentence that will help people understand what is shared and why) A flag active that says if the sharing is currently active for at least one member A flag owner , true for the document on the cozy of the sharer, and false on the other cozy instance A flag open_sharing : true if any member of the sharing except the read-only ones can add a new recipient false if only the owner can add a new recipient Some technical data ( created_at , updated_at , app_slug , preview_path , triggers , credentials ) A flag initial_sync present only when the initial replication is still running A number of files to synchronize for the initial sync, initial_number_of_files_to_sync (if there are no files to sync or the initial replication has finished, the field won\u2019t be here) A shortcut_id with the identifier of the shortcut file (when the recipient doesn\u2019t want to synchronize the documents on their Cozy instance) A list of sharing rules , each rule being composed of: a title , that will be displayed to the recipients before they accept the sharing a doctype (and a mime if the doctype is io.cozy.files ) a selector (by default, it\u2019s the id ) and values (one identifier, a list of identifiers, files and folders inside a folder, files that are referenced by the same document, documents bound to a previous sharing rule) local : by default false , but it can be true for documents that are useful for the preview page but doesn\u2019t need to be send to the recipients (e.g. a setting document of the application) add : a behavior when a new document matches this rule (the document is created, or it was a document that didn\u2019t match the rule and is modified and the new version matches the rule): none : the updates are never propagated (the default) push : the updates made on the owner are sent to the recipients sync : the updates on any member (except the read-only) are propagated to the other members update : a behavior when a document matched by this rule is modified.

In the sequence diagram below, we illustrate the steps occuring when Alice generates updates.

The identifiers are transformed with a XOR, using a key exchanged when the recipient accepts the sharing. In practice, it is useful when someone is revoked from a sharing, and accepts later the sharing again. It allows to avoid reusing the same identifiers for documents exchanged on the first sharing and on the second sharing, which can create some weird situations. For example, a cipher is shared between Alice and Bob when its revision is 3-aaa. Later, when the sharing is revoked, the document will be deleted on Bob\u2019s instance (the ciphers are deleted on recipients when a sharing is revoked), which creates a revision 4-bbb.

First and foremost, they have a binary attached to them that can be quite heavy. The stack also enforces some rules on them (e.g. a file can\u2019t be added to a deleted folder) and has some specific code for the tree nature of files and folders (e.g. a permission on a folder is inherited on all the files and folders inside it, even if they are several levels below). Thus, the workflow explained just before is not compatible with the files. As we need to introduce some code specific to the files, we have also wanted to improve the sharing of files. First, we don\u2019t want to force the recipients to put the shared folder at exactly the same place as the owner. In fact, we think that putting the shared folder in a folder called Shared with me is more friendly. We also think that a file that has been shared in the past but is no longer (the sharing has been revoked) can evolve on both the owner\u2019s cozy and on the recipients\u2019 cozy in different ways, and in such a case, it\u2019s more logical to consider them as different files. These two reasons implies, on a technical level, that the identifiers for files and folders are not the same on the owner and the recipients of a sharing. The replicator will translate the identifiers from one system to another during the replications. Of course, it will also translate the id in the sharing rules, and the dir_id to preserve the relationship between a file and its parent folder. The path attribute will be seen as a cache, and recomputed when a cozy instance receives a folder document from a sharing replication. We will continue to have a replication as close to the CouchDB replication as possible. It means we synchronize a state, and not looking for the history of operations like cozy-desktop does. It is less accurate and can lead more often to conflicts. The cozy instances are expected to be online most of the time and have a short delay for replications: we think that the conflicts will happen only on rares occasions.

For 3., we say that the owner instance wins: the file with the name in conflict on the owner instance will keep its name, and the other file with the same name will be renamed.

In particular, we try to converge to the same revisions on all the instances for the \u201cwinner\u201d file (and for the \u201closer\u201d too).

The sharing synchronization will move the directory to the trash for Alice and Charlie. Bob can continue to work on the files in this directory. If Charlie restores the directory from the trash, it will be put again in the sharing. And we can see that we have an issue: on Bob instance, we will have two copies on the files, at two different locations, but technically, they should have the same identifiers. It is not possible. To avoid that, we have to change the identifier, or more precisely, delete a file and recreate it with a new identifier. It means losing historical versions and some other things like sharing by links. It is an operation that takes a lot of resources. So, we need to be careful in how we do that.

With these constraints, the approache we have chosen is to put a copy of a file that was moved out of the sharing in the trash when this operation is replicated.

Thus, the other members of the sharing will have a copy of the file, but not the original file (sharing by links won\u2019t work on the copy for example), and the old versions of the file will be lost. We think it is an acceptable tradeoff between complexity, reliability, and matching the user expectations. Still, it has an important limitation. If Alice and Bob moves a file from the shared directory to somewhere else at the same time, and later, one of them is moving again the file inside the shared directory, we will be in a bad situation, where the replication algorithm can\u2019t synchronize the file.

Sharing by links \u00b6 A client-side application can propose sharing by links: The application must have a public route in its manifest. See Apps documentation for how to do that. The application can create a set of permissions for the shared documents, with codes. Another code called shortcode is also generated and associated with the code. This shortcode is much smaller (but secure), which is easier to be shared. See permissions documentation for the details. The application can then create a shareable link (e.g. https://calendar.cozy.example.net/public?sharecode=eiJ3iepoaihohz1Y ) by putting together the app sub-domain, the public route path, and a code for the permissions set. The app can then send this link by mail, via the jobs system , or just give it to the user, so he can transmit it to her friends via chat or other ways. When someone opens the shared link, the stack will load the public route, find the corresponding index.html file, and replace {{.Token}} inside it by a token with the same set of permissions that sharecode offers. This token can then be used as a Bearer token in the Authorization header for requests to the stack (or via cozy-client-js). NB: The shortcode can also be used as the Bearer . In this case, the corresponding sharecode will be matched on server-side If necessary, the application can list the permissions for the token by calling /permissions/self with this token. Cozy to cozy sharing \u00b6 The owner of a cozy instance can send and synchronize documents to others cozy users. Intents \u00b6 When a sharing is authorized, the user is redirected to their cozy on the application that was used for the sharing (when possible). It\u2019s possible to use a specific route to do so, via the intents. The application must declare an intent in its manifest for the action SHARING . The doctype of the intent must be the same as the doctype of the first rule of the sharing. In the redirect URL, the query string will have a sharing parameter with the sharing ID (but no intent parameter). Routes \u00b6 POST /sharings/ \u00b6 Create a new sharing. The sharing rules and recipients must be specified. The description , preview_path , and open_sharing fields are optional. The app_slug field is optional and is the slug of the web app by default. See the doc on io.cozy.sharings for in-depth explanation of all attributes . To create a sharing, no permissions on io.cozy.sharings are needed: an application can create a sharing on the documents for whose it has a permission.

It describes their input arguments object. See the jobs document to know more about the API context in which you can see how to use these arguments. log worker \u00b6 The log worker will just print in the log file the job sent to it. It can useful for debugging for example. thumbnail worker \u00b6 The thumbnail worker is used internally by the stack to generate thumbnails from the image files of a cozy instance. konnector worker \u00b6 The konnector worker is used to execute JS code that collects files and data from external providers, and put them in the Cozy. Its execution is detailed on the Konnector Worker specs . Job arguments \u00b6 To execute a konnector through a job, the expected arguments are the following: \"arguments\": { \"konnector\": <konnector_slug>, \"account\": <account_id> } service worker \u00b6 The service worker is used to process background jobs, generally to compute non-realtime user data. \"arguments\": { \"slug\": <app slug>, \"name\": <service name>, \"fields\": <custom fields> } Job arguments \u00b6 To execute a service through a job, the expected arguments are the following: \"arguments\": { \"name\": <service_name>, \"slug\": <application_slug> } push worker \u00b6 The push worker can be used to send push-notifications to a user\u2019s device. The options are: client_id : the ID of the oauth client to push a notification to. title : the title of the notification message : the content of the notification data : key-value string map for additional metadata (optional) priority : the notification priority: high or normal (optional) topic : the topic identifier of the notification (optional) sound : a sound associated with the notification (optional) Example \u00b6 { \"client_id\" : \"abcdef123123123\" , \"title\" : \"My Notification\" , \"message\" : \"My notification content.\" , \"priority\" : \"high\" } Permissions \u00b6 To use this worker from a client-side application, you should use the notifications API . sms worker \u00b6 The sms worker can be used to send SMS notifications to a user, via the notifications API . The phone number used is the primary phone number registered in the contact that has the flag me: true (see contact doctype ) Note: If an error happens during the send of the sms (for instance no phone number on the cozy or SMS provider not available), the content will be send by email as fallback. To use the sms worker, you need to configure your SMS provider: - first enable sms worker in your stack configuration - configure the notification configuration by setting your provider\u2019s informations. unzip worker \u00b6 The unzip worker can take a zip archive from the VFS, and will unzip the files inside it to a directory of the VFS. The options are: zip : the ID of the zip file destination : the ID of the directory where the files will be unzipped. Example \u00b6 { \"zip\" : \"8737b5d6-51b6-11e7-9194-bf5b64b3bc9e\" , \"destination\" : \"88750a84-51b6-11e7-ba90-4f0b1cb62b7b\" } Permissions \u00b6 To use this worker from a client-side application, you will need to ask the permission. It is done by adding this to the manifest: { \"permissions\" : { \"unzip-to-a-directory\" : { \"description\" : \"Required to unzip a file inside the cozy\" , \"type\" : \"io.cozy.jobs\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"POST\" ], \"selector\" : \"worker\" , \"values\" : [ \"unzip\" ] } } } zip worker \u00b6 The zip worker does pretty much the opposite of the unzip worker: it creates a zip archive from files in the VFS. The options are: files : a map with the the files to zip (their path in the zip as key, their VFS identifier as value) dir_id : the directory identifier where the zip archive will be put filename : the name of the zip archive. Note: it is possible to include only a page for a PDF file, by using an object with id and page instead of just the file identifier. Example \u00b6 { \"files\" : { \"selection/one.pdf\" : \"36abc4c0-90fe-11e9-b05b-1fa43ca781ef\" , \"selection/two.pdf\" : \"36eb54c8-90fe-11e9-aeca-03ddc3acf91c\" , \"selection/three.pdf\" : \"37284586-90fe-11e9-be6d-179f72076e43\" , \"selection/four.pdf\" : \"37655462-90fe-11e9-9059-8739e3746720\" , \"selection/five.pdf\" : \"379fedfc-90fe-11e9-849f-0bbe172eba5f\" , \"selection/front.pdf\" : { \"id\" : \"49ca9e50-1074-013d-361a-18c04daba326\" , \"page\" : 1 }, \"selection/back.pdf\" : { \"id\" : \"49ca9e50-1074-013d-361a-18c04daba326\" , \"page\" : 2 } }, \"dir_id\" : \"3657ce9c-90fe-11e9-b40b-33baf841bcb8\" , \"filename\" : \"selection.zip\" } Permissions \u00b6 To use this worker from a client-side application, you will need to ask the permission. It is done by adding this to the manifest: { \"permissions\" : { \"create-a-zip-archive\" : { \"description\" : \"Required to create a zip archive inside the cozy\" , \"type\" : \"io.cozy.jobs\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"POST\" ], \"selector\" : \"worker\" , \"values\" : [ \"zip\" ] } } } sendmail worker \u00b6 The sendmail worker can be used to send mail from the stack. It implies that the stack has properly configured an access to an SMTP server. You can see an example of configuration in the cozy.example.yaml file at the root of this repository. sendmail options fields are the following: mode : string specifying the mode of the send: noreply to send a notification mail to the user pending to send a mail to the user to confirm their new email address from to send a mail from the user support to send both an email to the support and a confirmation to the user campaign to send a non transactional email to the user via an SMTP server using the following configurations, in order of priority: campaign_mail.contexts.<context name> if defined campaign_mail otherwise mail as the final fallback to : list of object {name, email} representing the addresses of the recipients. (should not be used in noreply mode) subject : string specifying the subject of the mail parts : list of part objects {type, body} listing representing the content parts of the type string of the content type: either text/html or text/plain body string of the actual body content of the part attachments : list of objects {filename, content} that represent the files attached to the email, where the content is base64-encoded Examples \u00b6 // from mode sending mail from the user to a list of recipients { \"mode\" : \"from\" , \"to\" : [ { \"name\" : \"John Doe 1\" , \"email\" : \"john1@doe\" }, { \"name\" : \"John Doe 2\" , \"email\" : \"john2@doe\" } ], \"subject\" : \"Hey !\" , \"parts\" : [ { \"type\" : \"text/html\" , \"body\" : \"<h1>Hey !</h1>\" }, { \"type\" : \"text/plain\" , \"body\" : \"Hey !\" } ] } // noreply mode, sending a notification mail to the user { \"mode\" : \"noreply\" , \"subject\" : \"You've got a new file !\" , \"parts\" : [ { \"type\" : \"text/html\" , \"body\" : \"<h1>Hey !</h1>\" }, { \"type\" : \"text/plain\" , \"body\" : \"Hey !\" } ] } Permissions \u00b6 To use this worker from a client-side application, you will need to ask the permission. It is done by adding this to the manifest: { \"permissions\" : { \"mail-from-the-user\" : { \"description\" : \"Required to send mails from the user to his/her friends\" , \"type\" : \"io.cozy.jobs\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"POST\" ], \"selector\" : \"worker\" , \"values\" : [ \"sendmail\" ] } } } export \u00b6 The export worker can be used to generate allow the export of all data contained in the cozy. At the end of the export, a mail is sent to the user containing a link to access to its data. The progress of the export process can be followed with realtime events on the doctype io.cozy.exports . Its options are: parts_size : the size in bytes of the sizes index splitting done for multi-part download of files data max_age : the maximum age duration of the archive before it expires with_doctypes : the list of exported doctypes (exports all doctypes if empty) Example \u00b6 { \"parts_size\" : 52428800 , \"max_age\" : 60000000000 , // 1 minute \"with_doctypes\" : [ \"io.cozy.accounts\" , \"io.cozy.files\" ] // empty or null means all doctypes } import \u00b6 The import worker can be used to import the data from an export. The instance will be reset before importing data to avoid complex logic of reconciliation. The instance is blocked during the import, and a mail is sent at the end of the import, when the instance can be accessed again. Its options are: manifest_url : the URL of the manifest for the exported data. Example \u00b6 { \"manifest_url\" : \"http://cozy.localhost:8080/move/exports/QUFBQUFGLVg5b3c0WTJNNU9HRmpPR0V4WlRnd01XVTJZMlU0T0RjeE5UaGpNVEF3TWpKbVplblFfRWZWUVAtRGJXU0lnV2tIZ3NsVHN5dUR6V0ZIdVdSeERLb196X3A0\" } Permissions \u00b6 To use this worker from a client-side application, you will need to ask the permission. It is done by adding this to the manifest: { \"permissions\" : { \"mail-from-the-user\" : { \"description\" : \"Required to create a export of the user's data\" , \"type\" : \"io.cozy.jobs\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"POST\" ], \"selector\" : \"worker\" , \"values\" : [ \"export\" ] } } } trash-files worker \u00b6 This worker is used only by the stack: when the user asks to clean the trash, the stack will delete the files from CouchDB and put a job for this worker. The deletion of files in Swift is slow, and can be done via this worker asynchronously. The behavior is not the same for all the VFS: afero: all the work is done during the HTTP request, no job is pushed Swift layout v1: all the work is done during the HTTP request, no job is pushed Swift layout v2: the files are deleted in CouchDB during the HTTP request, and they are deleted in Swift via the job Swift layout v3: the files are deleted in CouchDB during the HTTP request, the file versions are deleted in CouchDB via the job, and the files and their versions are deleted in Swift via the job. clean-old-trashed worker \u00b6 This worker is used to automatically delete files and directories that are in the trash for too long. The threshold for deletion is configurable per context in the config file, via the fs.auto_clean_trashed_after parameter. share workers \u00b6 The stack have 4 workers to power the sharings (internal usage only): share-group , to add/remove members to a sharing share-track , to update the io.cozy.shared database share-replicate , to start a replicator for most documents share-upload , to upload files Share-group \u00b6 When a contact is added to or removed from a group, the change should be reflected in the group\u2019s sharings\u2019 recipients. The message is composed of the contact ID, the list of groups added and the list of groups removed. Share-track \u00b6 The message is composed of 3 fields: the sharing ID, the rule index, and the doctype. The event is similar to a realtime event: a verb, a document, and optionaly the old version of this document. Share-replicate and share-upload \u00b6 The message is composed of a sharing ID and a count of the number of errors (i.e. the number of times this job was retried). notes-save \u00b6 This is another worker for the interal usage of the stack. It allows to write to the VFS a note in an asynchronous way. Writing to the VFS after each tiny change would kill the performance for realtime collaboration, so the stack writes the note to a cache, and has a trigger with debounce to persist the note to the VFS later. clean-clients \u00b6 This internal worker will delete unused OAuth clients.

Usage \u00b6 As a Components library \u00b6 Add Cozy UI to a dependency to your project. yarn add cozy-ui If you use the transpiled components (from cozy-ui/transpiled/react ), you need to import the stylesheet (once): import Button from 'cozy-ui/transpiled/react/deprecated/Button' import 'cozy-ui/transpiled/react/stylesheet.css' < Button /> You\u2019re now ready to use Cozy UI\u2019s React components Utility classes \u00b6 React components only come with the needed style, nothing more, but you may need some more utility classes to build your apps. To do so you have at your disposal a special CSS build cozy-ui.utils.min.css that you can add like this: import 'cozy-ui/dist/cozy-ui.utils.min.css' As a vanilla CSS library (deprecated) \u00b6 The entire library is also available as a good ol\u2019 CSS library. You can simply add it to your app by linking the distributed minified file. < link media = \"all\" rel = \"stylesheet\" href = \u201ccozy-ui/dist/cozy-ui.min.css\" /> Develop on Cozy UI \u00b6 If you want to develop inside cozy-ui, you need a local version cozy-ui. git clone git@github.com:cozy/cozy-ui.git Install \u00b6 First nvm use (to set node version as defined in .nvmrc) then yarn install Develop inside the styleguidist \u00b6 It is convenient when modifying a component to use the styleguide site. yarn makeSpriteAndPalette # Create sprite and palette yarn start # Transpile the files in watch mode yarn build:css:all # Build CSS files needed by the documentation yarn start:doc # Run the styleguide in watch mode Add a component \u00b6 If you want to add a new component, you must follow these steps: Add the new component in /react folder with its README.md file Expose it in the API by adding it in react/index.js Add it in the documentation by modifying docs/styleguide.config.js If necessary you can add snapshots for it by modifying react/examples.spec.jsx and updating them yarn makeSpriteAndPalette && yarn build && yarn test -u Remember to propagate the possible ref with React.forwardRef . See forwardRef documentation Try to think of ARIA attributes if you are coding new components Be careful to respect MUI API when creating a new component. See our guidelines to create a new component . Rename/Move a component \u00b6 When renaming or moving a Cozy-UI component, it may cause a breaking change. In this case, you should provide a codemod as much as possible to fix it. Guidelines for component development \u00b6 Use material UI whenever possible Override material UI components inside makeOverrides.js when necessary Avoid stylus to style new components based on MUI and prefer /helpers/makeStyles Use semantic variables for colors from stylus/settings/palettes.styl , or color from theme objects in makeStyles Add an icon \u00b6 If you want to add a new icon to cozy-ui, you must follow these steps: If you SVG file is an icon (not an illustration), verify that the file doesn\u2019t have any fill or fill-opacity properties. Remove them if necessary Add the SVG in the assets/icons/[ui || illus] folder Optimize it with yarn svgo assets/icons/[ui || illus]/[new icon file name] Generate the react component by running yarn makeSvgr assets/icons/[ui || illus]/[new icon file name] Update the documentation by adding the new file in react/Icon/Readme.md . If it\u2019s an icon, add it in SVGr icons and Available UI icons sections, or in SVGr illustrations and Available illustrations sections if it\u2019s an illustration Don\u2019t forget to check the icon\u2019s color on different theme (inverted, etc.) Update the tests by running yarn makeSpriteAndPalette && yarn build && yarn test -u Develop inside an app \u00b6 Sometimes, you want to develop on a component, from the context of an app. Then you need to link cozy-ui with yarn link . Since cozy-ui is transpiled, when linking you must first yarn release . If you change the icons, or the palette, you must run yarn release again. cd cozy-ui yarn makeSpriteAndPalette # if first time yarn link yarn start # Launch transpilation yarn makeSpriteAndPalette # if you change icons or palette Then in your application folder, you can link to your local Cozy UI. You can use rlink instead of yarn link . It will prevent common build problems due to module resolution inside symlinked folders. If your application doesn\u2019t use cozy-ui directly as dependency but through a library, you have to use rlink inside your application folder, not inside the library\u2019s one. rlink only copies the build and not the node_modules of cozy-ui, so you have to install a version of cozy-ui before making a rlink . cd my-app rlink cozy-ui # Prefer rlink to yarn link yarn start All your modifications in your local Cozy UI will now be visible in your application! Making a demo when creating a pull request \u00b6 When sending a PR, if your changes have graphic impacts, it is useful for the reviewers if you have deployed a version of the styleguidist containing your changes to your fork\u2019s repository. Don\u2019t forget to change USERNAME by yours. yarn build:all && yarn deploy:doc --repo git@github.com:USERNAME/cozy-ui.git \u26a0\ufe0f If the deploy:doc failed, you need to checkout your dev branch by doing git checkout - Unit testing \u00b6 Be aware that snapshots in unit tests use the transpiled version of cozy-ui. Therefore if you make changes and need to update the snapshots, you need to transpile first. yarn makeSpriteAndPalette && yarn build && yarn test -u We suggest to use @testing-library/react over enzyme for tests. We have historically used enzyme but we prefer the philosophy behind testing-library since it pushes to test for what the user sees. For complex components, we expose testing helpers in the testing file in their respective folders. import { getCloseButton , getAllDialogs } from 'cozy-ui/transpiled/react/CozyDialogs/testing' it ( 'should close dialog' , () => { const onClose = jest . fn () const root = render (< MyApp onCloseDialog = { onClose } />) const dialog = getDialog ( root ) const closeBtn = getCloseButton ( dialog ) fireEvent . click ( closeBtn ) expect ( onClose ). toHaveBeenCalled () }) UI regression testing \u00b6 Components in cozy-ui are showcased with React Styleguidist . To prevent UI regressions, for each PR, each component is screenshotted and compared to the master version to find any regression (thanks Argos !). If your app uses React Styleguidist , cozy-ui provides rsg-screenshots , a CLI tool to take screenshots of your components (uses Puppeteer under the hood). yarn add cozy-ui # The rsg-screenshots binary is now installed yarn makeSpriteAndPalette yarn build:doc:react # Build our styleguide, the output directory is docs/react rsg-screenshots --screenshot-dir screenshots/ --styleguide-dir docs/react # Each component in the styleguide will be screenshotted and saved inside the screenshots/ directory See our travis configuration for more information.

Therefore we will use the classical stack: a JavaScript web application and cordova At the end of this documentation , you will find how-tos to help you with cordova configuration , webpack builds and cordova deployments for Android and iOS . To create your first Cozy application , just follow the guide. As you can read there, Cozy applications are served by the Cozy server, this is the way that Cozy applications retrieve a token to query data. In the case of a mobile application, you need to retrieve a token differently. Hopefully we provide everything you need to do it easily. You\u2019ll need two libraries: cozy-client ( source ) cozy-bar ( source ) In the case of Cozy web applications served by the Cozy server, these two libraries are injected in the html file with variables {{.CozyClientJS}} and {{.CozyBar}} . Setup index.html \u00b6 First thing first, add JavaScript libraries files into your index.html : <!DOCTYPE html> < html lang = \"en\" > < head > < meta charset = \"utf-8\" > < title > mobile Cozy application with Cordova </ title > < script src = \"cozy-client.js\" ></ script > < script src = \"cozy-bar.js\" ></ script > </ head > < body > <!-- page content --> </ body > </ html > Connect to Cozy server \u00b6 When an user will start your mobile Cozy application, she/he will need to point to her/his server url to ask for permissions for her/his device. This is done by our library cozy-client , you just need to add a HTML form: < form id = \"form\" > < label > What is your cozy server url? < input name = \"url\" id = \"url\" type = \"text\" /> </ label > < button type = \"submit\" > Submit </ button > </ form > const urlInput = document . getElementById ( \"url\" ); const form = document . getElementById ( \"form\" ); form . addEventListener ( \"submit\" , registerClient ); function registerClient ( event ) { event . preventDefault (); const url = urlInput . value ; const { client , token } = await cozyClient . register ( url ); // do whatever you need with client and token like persist } JS Bin on jsbin.com When cozyClient.register(url) is called, the cordova inapp browser plugin is used to display a password request and a permission acceptation page to let the end-user to register her/his device. That\u2019s all! Then you can use the cozy-client library as you would within a classic Cozy application . Initialize the Cozy bar \u00b6 The Cozy bar needs some information to be initialized and its initialization must be done in your front-end code: cozy . bar . init ({ appName : \"App Name\" , iconPath : require ( \"./assets/app-icon.svg\" ), lang : \"en-US\" , replaceTitleOnMobile : true }) Use Cordova \u00b6 Install and setup cordova \u00b6 Cordova is a tool to build Android and iOS applications from a web app. It works with a CLI that needs node . Look at the cordova documentation to install everything needed . Once cordova is installed, just run cordova create cozy-app com.example.cozyapp CozyApp and you get the following structure: ./ \u251c\u2500\u2500 config.xml \u251c\u2500\u2500 hooks \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 README.md \u251c\u2500\u2500 platforms \u251c\u2500\u2500 plugins \u2514\u2500\u2500 www \u251c\u2500\u2500 css \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 index.css \u251c\u2500\u2500 img \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 logo.png \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.html \u2514\u2500\u2500 js \u2514\u2500\u2500 index.js 7 directories, 6 files Note: everything you put in www/ will be served as your application content. Configure your build tool \u00b6 If you use a build tool to transpile your JavaScript code, you need to configure your tool to output the build into www/ . webpack configuration \u00b6 As Webpack is the most used build tool we will show you how to configure it with cordova: Create a webpack.config.js on the root folder of your project with: const path = require ( 'path' ); module . exports = { entry : './src/app.js' , output : { filename : 'bundle.js' , path . resolve ( __dirname , 'www' ) } } And add the output bundle in the www/index.html file: < html > < head > ... </ head > < body > ... < script src = \"bundle.js\" ></ script > </ body > </ html > See the official webpack documentation for more details.

This can significantly speed up development in a few ways: Retain application state which is lost during a full reload. Save valuable development time by only updating what\u2019s changed. Modifications made to CSS/JS in the source code results in an instant browser update which is almost comparable to changing styles directly in the browser\u2019s dev tools. For a Cozy application, having this feature allows you to have the specific changed part reloaded in your browser without reloading again the cozy-bar , the cozy-client and other layout components. Notice: The HMR will be explained here only for applications build using Webpack. Is it available for my app? \u00b6 If you created your application (React or Vue) using Create Cozy App a.k.a CCA (from v1) and: For React, you didn\u2019t change the way react-hot-loader is used For Vue, you didn\u2019t change the module.hot part in your entry point index.js (in src/targets/<target> ) Then, you dont\u2019 have anything to do. See the next part of this tutorial to use HMR \ud83d\ude0e If you did change these parts or you didn\u2019t create your application initialy using Create Cozy App , you can see the part Make HMR available in my application . Run my app with HMR \u00b6 To have a full HMR experience, you\u2019ll have to do two things here: Run webpack watching your changes with a webpack-dev-server and --hot option Disable CSPs in the target Cozy (the Cozy CSPs is blocking HMR script) But thanks to the last version of cozy-scripts , all of that are handled for you with the command cozy-scripts start : yarn cozy-scripts start --hot --browser # or if you have the last package.json from CCA, you can do yarn start How can I run my webpack and my stack in different terminals? \u00b6 First, you can pass an option to disable the stack handling by the start command: yarn cozy-scripts start --hot --browser --no-stack # or if you have the last package.json from CCA, you can do yarn start --no-stack Then, as said, to have your application running in a Cozy with HMR, your have to disable CSPs when running the stack. For that, cozy-scripts has a dedicated config file to pass to your Docker image in cozy-scripts/stack/disableCSP.yaml . You can use this config by running your stack in another terminal like: # in your app root directory docker run --rm -it -p 8080 :8080 -p 5984 :5984 -v \\\" $( pwd ) /build \\\" :/data/cozy-app/app -v \\\" $( pwd ) /node_modules/cozy-scripts/stack/disableCSP.yaml \\\" :/etc/cozy/cozy.yaml cozy/cozy-app-dev Make HMR available in my application \u00b6 For a React application \u00b6 You have to use react-hot-loader inside your main App component like this: import React from 'react' import { hot } from 'react-hot-loader' const App = () => ( ... ) export default hot ( module )( App ) That\u2019s it.

By default that Unix socket is owned by the user root and other users can only access it using sudo. If you don\u2019t want to use sudo when you use the docker command, create a Unix group called docker and add users to it. When the Docker daemon starts, it creates a Unix socket accessible by members of the docker group. On some Linux distributions, the system automatically creates this group when installing Docker Engine using a package manager. In that case, there is no need for you to manually create the group. The docker group grants root-level privileges to the user. For details on how this impacts security in your system, see Docker Daemon Attack Surface . Notice: The default passphrase configured by cozy-stack in the Docker container is cozy . Ephemeral instance \u00b6 To run a ephemeral instance, on the ~/cozy/myapp directory, you have to mount the folder inside the server to /data/cozy-app .

This prevent Docker from keeping a lot of unused stopped images - `-it` allow to attach an interactive terminal, so you\u2019ll be able to use the command line inside the server - `-p 8080:8080`: the server listens on port 8080 on the virtual machine. We forward this port to the same port on your local machine. To use another local port, for example 9090, use `-p 9090:8080` - `-p 8025:8025`: Cozy requires a mail server. In the development image, we don\u2019t use a real email server, but a software that can display the sent messages. Just point your browser to `http://localhost:8025/` to display the messages sent by the server - `--name cozydev`: name the running virtual machine `cozydev`, so you can easily refer to it from other Docker commands. For example, if you want to connect to a shell inside the server, you can use `docker exec cozydev -it /bin/bash` - `-v \"$HOME/cozy/myapp\":/data/cozy-app`: this mount the local folder, where your application leaves, inside the container. This is what make the application available on the server With data persistence \u00b6 If you want to persist data, you have to mount two folders from the virtual server to local folders: /var/lib/couchdb (database) and /data/cozy-storage (the virtual filesystem). This can be achieved by adding two options to the command line starting with -v which will store the server\u2019s data into $HOME/cozy/data/ . $ docker run --rm -it \\ -p 8080 :8080 \\ -p 8025 :8025 \\ --name cozydev \\ -v \" $HOME /cozy/myapp\" :/data/cozy-app \\ -v \" $HOME /cozy/data/db\" :/var/lib/couchdb \\ -v \" $HOME /cozy/data/storage\" :/data/cozy-storage \\ cozy/cozy-app-dev Run with a custom stack config file \u00b6 The cozy-stack config file can be useful to change the log level for example.

This might be useful for heavy computations or for tasks triggered after some events, typically after data is retrieved through konnectors or mobile/desktop sync, without the user being on the application. In contrast to konnectors, services have the same permissions as the web application and are not intended to collect information from the outside. It is rather meant to asynchronously analyse data inside the cozy and emit some output once the task is done. However, they share the same mechanisms as the konnectors to describe how and when they should be executed: via our trigger system . Example \u00b6 You can find an example of an existing service in the cozy-banks app . CozyClient instantiation \u00b6 By using fromEnv , you will be able to use the service in dev mode (via cozy-konnector-dev see Execution ) or in production. const client = CozyClient . fromEnv ( process . env , { schema }) You may need to add this line to your service to use the fetch for node: global . fetch = require ( 'node-fetch' ). default Service declaration \u00b6 The service must be declared in the app manifest . For example: \"services\" : { \"onOperationCreate\" : { \"type\" : \"node\" , \"file\" : \"onOperationCreate.js\" , \"trigger\" : \"@event io.cozy.bank.operations:CREATED\" , \"debounce\" : \"3m\" } } Here is an explanation of the fields: type : describe the code type (only node for now). file : the single (packaged) file containing the code to execute as a service. It must be the relative path to the built service\u2019s file, not the source one. Expl: /services/name-of-service/built-file.js . Look at your build folder or build/watch console output to find it. trigger : what triggers the service. It must follow the available triggers described in the jobs documentation . In this example, the trigger is a bank operation creation. debounce (optionnal): The debounce parameter can be used to limit the number of jobs created in a burst. It delays the creation of the job on the first input by the given time argument, and if the trigger has its condition matched again during this period, it won\u2019t create another job. Its syntax is the one understood by go\u2019s time.ParseDuration . If this parameter is omitted, the service will be executed as soon as it can. Build \u00b6 The service must be packaged into a single file containing all the dependencies. An example of a webpack rule is available here . Note that target: 'node' is important as the service is run as a Node.js process. In this example, the services are built alongside your app using yarn watch . If you use cozy-script , you should use watch and not start to have the service built. Stack \u00b6 As the service is run on a dedicated process on the server side, a running stack is necessary. You can either use a stack installed with docker or directly from source . Some configuration is required to execute the service and store the produced logs, to facilitate the development. The following instructions are for a stack installed from source, but you can adapt it for a docker installation: you have to download the default config file , modify it as described below and indicate its location through the docker command, as explained here . In the following, we assume that your $HOME is /home/alice, so change accordingly to your own $HOME . Copy the default config file if not already done \u00b6 Create a directory ~/.cozy and copy the default configuration file into it. Be careful, the file name and location matter, as explained in the config documentation . cp cozy-stack/cozy.example.yaml ~/.cozy/cozy.yaml ` Edit the config file \u00b6 Edit the file ~/.cozy/cozy.yaml and change the line after the konnectors: entry to have this: cmd : /home/alice/.cozy/scripts/konnector-node-run.sh [Optional] Then, after the entry fs: url : file:///home/alice/.cozy/storage Create the script to execute the service \u00b6 Copy the file cozy-stack/scripts/konnector-node-run.sh to ~/.cozy/konnector-node-run.sh : Then you need to chmod +x ~/.cozy/scripts/konnector-node-run.sh Be sure to have node in your /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin folder. If not, you can add a symlink to node in one of those folder, for example by typing ln -s $(which node) /usr/local/bin/node Get your service logs in a isolated file \u00b6 Edit your ~/.cozy/konnector-node-run.sh by adding a tee output. set -o pipefail node \" ${ arg } \" 2 > & 1 | tee -a ~/.cozy/services.log Now you can tail -f ~/.cozy/services.log to watch logs in real time. Install your app \u00b6 To install the app containing the service on your local stack, you must give the path of your build: cozy-stack apps install <app_name> file://<build_path> # Example: # cozy-stack apps install banks file:///home/alice/cozy-banks/build Each time you make modifications to your service, you must update the app on the stack to propagate the changes: cozy-stack apps update <app_name> Env variables \u00b6 When executing a service, cozy-stack injects some environment variables, listed here , so you can use them in your service, typically through process.env.<env_var_name> . Execution \u00b6 The service will be run each time the trigger condition is met, e.g. a bank operation. However, you can force its execution thanks to the cozy-konnector-dev CLI, which can be useful for developement. Be aware, that in that case, you can\u2019t rely on any of the stack provided variables To install locally: yarn add --dev cozy-jobs-cli To run: yarn run cozy-konnector-dev -m <app_manifest> <mybuiltservice.js> Be carefull the mybuiltservice.js must be the built file of your service, not the source. If your mybuiltservice.js is not executable and not recognize by node, you may need this script in your app folder to fix that. Just change the target path. #!/bin/bash target = \"build/services/sync-index-displayName/contacts.js\" firstChar = $( head -c 1 $target ) chmod +x $target if [[ $firstChar ! = \\# * ]] ; then sed -i '' '1i\\ #!/usr/bin/env node ' $target fi cozy-konnector-dev -m manifest.webapp $target", "title": "Develop a service from your application"}, {"location": "howTos/dev/services/#what-is-it-for", "text": "Applications may require server-side code execution that could not, or should not, be in the client.

Depending on your point of view, Cozy can be seen as : A place to keep your personal data A core API to handle the data Your web apps, and also the mobile & desktop clients A coherent User Experience. The whole platform is designed around 3 key values : Simple , Versatile , Yours . These values have a lot of meaning for Cozy in all aspects. From an architectural point of view, they are declined like this: simple and easy to understand and deploy. Cozy doesn\u2019t require to setup and manage a lot of micro-services; versatile : your server is comfortable anywhere. You can host a single instance on a small Raspberry \u03c0 at home, or a cluster of thousands instances on dedicated servers inside a datacenter; yours : the users are the owners of their data, they keep the control. They can migrate their data from one server to another, and are not dependant from a single hosting provider. As we say: \u201cyou will stay because you can leave\u201d; Architecture overview \u00b6 Several layers can be distinguished. From inside to outside: the core is a database that store all user data; the database is accessible through a layer that control accesses and expose a REST API; Web applications and other clients offer nice user interfaces to interact with the data. The server (Cozy-stack - documentation ) \u00b6 The server consist of a single process. We call it the Cozy stack . The server is in charge of serving the Web applications users have installed from the application store. It provides its services through a REST API that allows to: create, update, delete documents inside the database; authenticate users and client applications; send emails; launch jobs on the server. Connectors that import data from remote websites are some sort of jobs. Jobs can be one time tasks (sending a message) or periodic tasks. Some jobs, like the connectors, that require executing third party code on the server side, are sandboxed (we use nsjail for now). \u2026 The server also allow to access the database replication API, allowing to sync documents between the server and local databases, for example in mobile clients. Two authentication methods are available: Web applications running on the server get a session token when the user log in; OAuth2 for other applications. The database \u00b6 CouchDB is a document database. Everything, from user data to server settings, is stored inside typed documents, identified by an unique id. Two request methods are allowed: map-reduce or Mango , a specific query language. Every document has a doctype , and we keep an index of the definition of every doctype. Binary data are stored outside the database. Depending on the server configuration, they may be stored on a file system or a dedicated object storage like swift . The datasystem layer inside the Cozy stack is in charge of controlling access rights on documents and binaries. It allows fine gained access control, on a whole doctype or on a set of documents. The applications \u00b6 There are two kind of applications: web applications : Single Page Applications (SPA) written in HTML and JavaScript that run inside the user\u2019s browser. They interact with the server through its API. This API allows to manipulate data and files and to perform miscellaneous tasks, like send emails connectors : Small application written in JavaScript, running on the server, that import your data from remote sources. The server provides services to applications: real time notifications of events; methods allowing applications to communicate and share data; interapps : applications can expose \u201ccapabilities\u201d that other apps can call. For instance an app can expose the capability to pick a photo or to create a contact. methods allowing sharing of documents between servers. This is a peer-to-peer protocol so that even users hosted on different infrastructure can share their data which are synchronized (the cozy stack propagates modifications between users servers). Application store \u00b6 An application registry lists every available applications, and their characteristics. Each application can: create its own doctypes; request permission to access documents; offer services to other applications; register publics routes; create jobs that will be run on server side. Application isolation \u00b6 Each application uses its own sub-domain, so it gets sandboxed inside the browser: other application are not able to steal its access token or access its data. We use Content Security Policy to control what the application is allowed to do. For example, Web applications running inside Cozy are not allowed to send requests to other websites. This allows a strict control over applications, preventing them to leak your data.

From an architectural point of view, they are declined like this: simple and easy to understand and deploy. Cozy doesn\u2019t require to setup and manage a lot of micro-services; versatile : your server is comfortable anywhere. You can host a single instance on a small Raspberry \u03c0 at home, or a cluster of thousands instances on dedicated servers inside a datacenter; yours : the users are the owners of their data, they keep the control.

All you need to have is: NodeJS 20 Yarn : a NodeJS package manager, like npm Docker to have a Cozy for dev Some basics about developing a single page application in HTML/JS or you just want to learn :) Install the development environment \u00b6 The only tool required to have a Cozy for development is Docker. Install Docker for OSX Install Docker for Windows (We have been told that installing Docker on some familial flavours of Windows may be a bit difficult. It has not been tested yet for this documentation.) Install Docker for GNU/linux: Ubuntu / Fedora / Debian / CentOs On GNU/Linux, according to the documentation : \u00ab The docker daemon binds to a Unix socket instead of a TCP port. By default that Unix socket is owned by the user root and other users can only access it using sudo. If you don\u2019t want to use sudo when you use the docker command, create a Unix group called docker and add users to it. Be warned that the docker group grants privileges equivalent to the root user. You should have a look at Docker\u2019s documentation on security . Every application running inside Cozy is a client-side HTML5 application interacting with your data through the API of the server. To develop an application, you\u2019ll require a running Cozy server. The easiest way is to use the Docker image for developers we provide. Download it for now: docker pull cozy/cozy-app-dev Note We update this image on a regular basis with the latest version of the server and our library. Don\u2019t forget to update the image by running docker pull cozy/cozy-app-dev from time to time to keep your Cozy dev up to date. Create your application \u00b6 You can boostrap your application from scratch if you want, but we highly recommand to use our dedicated community tool create-cozy-app to bootstrap very easily a Cozy application for you. This tool will generate an application using React, the framework we internally use in the Cozy Front team. But options are available if you want to use other frameworks. To do so, run directly create-cozy-app without installing it globally by using the yarn create cozy-app command to bootstrap your application: yarn create cozy-app mycozyapp The script will download some dependencies (may take a while) and ask you a few questions, then create an application skeleton inside mycozyapp . Here is a quick demo of what\u2019s happening: If the yarn create cozy-app command fails with the There should only be one folder in a package cache [...] error, then run yarn cache clean and try again You\u2019ll also need a running cozy-stack server as a backend server. You can use the docker image you downloaded earlier. Note: We disable CSP since we\u2019re using a wepback-dev-server by defaut to get HMR that runs on localhost and not on cozy.localhost . This should not be used in production ! Please check the behavior of your application once you built it on production mode and have enabled CSP back. touch ~/cozy.yaml # You can edit this file to configure the stack docker run -ti --rm -p 8080 :8080 -p 5984 :5984 -p 8025 :8025 -e COZY_DISABLE_CSP = 1 -v $( pwd ) /mycozyapp/build:/data/cozy-app/mycozyapp -v ~/cozy.yaml:/etc/cozy/cozy.yaml cozy/cozy-app-dev Alternatively, you can build cozy-stack locally. You can follow the install instructions here . Once it is installed, you can run it with cozy-stack serve --appdir <app-name>://<app-build-path> --disable-csp . For instance: cozy-stack serve --appdir mycozyapp://home/claude/dev/mycozyapp/build --disable-csp That\u2019s it! You can start developing: cd mycozyapp yarn start This command will run webpack in a watching mode with a server (webpack-dev-server) to serve application assets. Your application will be available at http://mycozyapp.cozy.localhost:8080 . Password is cozy . In this mode HMR (Hot Module Replacement) is available. Going Further \u00b6 How the application works? \u00b6 The minimal application consist of only two files: an HTML file, index.html , with the markup and the code of your application a manifest describing the application. It\u2019s a JSON file named manifest.webapp with the name of the application, the permissions it requires\u2026 We\u2019ll have a deeper look to its content later. Your application requires some informations to interact with the server API, for example the URL of its entrypoint, and an auth token. This data will be dynamically injected into index.html when it serves the page. So the index.html file has to contain some string that will be replaced by the server. The general syntax of this variables is {{\u2026}} , so don\u2019t use this syntax for other purpose in the page, for example inside comments. You can use the following variables: {{.Domain}} : will be substituted by the URL of the API entrypoint {{.Token}} : will be replaced by a token that authenticate your application when accessing the API {{.Locale}} : the lang of the instance {{.AppName}} : the name of the application {{.AppNamePrefix}} : the name prefix of the application {{.AppSlug}} : the slug of the application {{.AppEditor}} : the editor of the application {{.IconPath}} : will be replaced by HTML code to display the favicon {{.CozyClientJS}} : will be replaced with HTML code to inject the Cozy client library (old Cozy client) {{.CozyBar}} : will be replaced with HTML code to inject the upper menu bar {{.ThemeCSS}} : will be replaced by the theme.css . It is empty by default, but can be overrided by using contexts . {{.Favicon}} : will be replaced by the favicon served by the stack. This allows to get this kind of index.html : <!DOCTYPE html> < html lang = \"{{.Locale}}\" > < head > < meta charset = \"utf-8\" > < title > My Awesome App for Cozy </ title > < meta name = \"viewport\" content = \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" > < link rel = \"stylesheet\" src = \"my-app.css\" > {{.ThemeCSS}} {{.CozyClientJS}} {{.CozyBar}} </ head > < body > < div role = \"application\" data-cozy-token = \"{{.Token}}\" data-cozy-stack = \"{{.Domain}}\" > </ div > < script src = \"my-app.js\" ></ script > </ body > </ html > Read the application manifest \u00b6 Each application must have a \u201cmanifest\u201d. It\u2019s a JSON file named manifest.webapp stored at the root of the application directory. It describes the application, the type of documents it uses, the permissions it requires\u2026 Here\u2019s a sample manifest: { \"name\" : \"My Awesome application\" , \"name_prefix\" : \"\" , \"slug\" : \"myapp\" , \"permissions\" : { \"apps\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.apps\" }, \"permissions\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.permissions\" }, \"settings\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.settings\" }, \"sample\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.dev.sample\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"GET\" , \"POST\" , \"PUT\" , \"PATCH\" , \"DELETE\" ] }, \"jobs\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.jobs\" } }, \"routes\" : { \"/\" : { \"folder\" : \"/\" , \"index\" : \"index.html\" , \"public\" : false }, \"/public\" : { \"folder\" : \"/public\" , \"index\" : \"index.html\" , \"public\" : true } } } Permissions \u00b6 Applications require permissions to use most of the APIs. Permissions can be described inside the manifest, so the server can ask the user to grant them during installation. Applications can also request permissions at run time. A permission must at least contain a target, the type of objects the application want to interact with. Can be a document type, or an action on the server. By default, all permissions on this object are granted, but we can also request fine grained permissions, for example limiting to read access. We can also limit the scope to a subset of the documents. In the manifest, each permission is an object, with a random name and some properties: type : mandatory the document type or action name description : a text that will be displayed to the user to explain why the application require this permission verbs : an array of HTTP verbs. For example, to limit permissions to read access, use [\"GET\"] selector : a document attribute to limit access to a subset of documents values : array of allowed values for this attribute. An application can request a token that grant access to a subset of its own permissions. For example if the application has full access to the files, it can obtain a token that give only read access on a file. Thus, the application can make some documents publicly available. The public page of the application will use this token asauthentication token when accessing the API. Samples \u00b6 Application requiring full access to files: { \"permissions\" : { \"files\" : { \"description\" : \"\u2026\" , \"type\" : \"io.cozy.files\" }, } } Application wanting to be able to read the contact information of cozy@cozycloud.cc { \"permissions\" : { \"contact\" : { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.contacts\" , \"verbs\" : [ \"GET\" ], \"selector\" : \"email\" , \"values\" : [ \"cozy@cozycloud.cc\" ] } } } Routing \u00b6 The application must declare all of its URLs (routes) inside the manifest. A route is an object associating an URL to a HTML file. Each route has the following properties: folder : the base folder of the route index : the name of the file inside this folder public : a boolean specifying whether the route is public or private (default). Sample: \"routes\" : { \"/admin\" : { \"folder\" : \"/\" , \"index\" : \"admin.html\" , \"public\" : false }, \"/public\" : { \"folder\" : \"/public\" , \"index\" : \"index.html\" , \"public\" : true }, \"/assets\" : { \"folder\" : \"/assets\" , \"public\" : true } } Behind the magic \u00b6 Some server APIs may not be available right now through the library. If you want to use one of this method, you\u2019ll have to call it manually. We\u2019ll describe here how to access the API without using the Cozy Client library. Connecting to the API requires three things: its URL, injected into the page through the {{.Domain}} variable the application auth token, injected into the page through the {{.Token}} variable. Each request sent to the server must include this token in the Authorization header the session cookie, created when you connect to your server. This is an HttpOnly cookie , meaning that JavaScript applications can\u2019t read it. This prevent a malicious script to steal the cookie. Here\u2019s a sample code that get API informations provided by the server and query the API: < div data-cozy-token = \"{{.Token}}\" data-cozy-domain = \"{{.Domain}}\" /> document . addEventListener ( 'DOMContentLoaded' , () => { \"use strict\" ; const app = document . querySelector ( '[data-cozy-token]' ); fetch ( `// ${ app . dataset . cozyDomain } /apps` , { method : 'GET' , headers : { Authorization : `Bearer ${ app . dataset . cozyToken } ` // Here we use the auth token }, credentials : 'include' // Don\u2019t forget to include the session cookie }) . then (( response ) => { if ( response . ok ) { response . json (). then (( result ) => { console . log ( result ); }); } else { throw new Error ( 'Network response was not ok.' ); } }) . catch (( error ) => { console . log ( 'There has been a problem with your fetch operation: ' + error . message ); }); }); Handle data with cozy-client \u00b6 cozy-client is a simple and declarative way of managing cozy-stack API calls and resulting data. It is a convenient and powerful way to bind cozy-stack queries to your components. Getting started React integration API docs Discover the Cozy Bar \u00b6 The Cozy Bar is a component that displays the Cozy menu on the top of your application and allows inter-apps features like content sharing. Your application interacts with this component through cozy-bar.js , a library injected into your pages by the server when you add {{.CozyBar}} in the header. It exposes an API behind the window.cozy.bar namespace. Before using it, you have to initialize the library: window.cozy.bar.init({appName: \"Mon application\"}) . Style with Cozy UI \u00b6 If you plan to build a webapp to run on Cozy, you\u2019ll probably want to use a simple and elegant solution to build your interfaces without the mess of dealing with complex markup and CSS.

If not done yet, you want to check the getting started guide . Implement your konnector \u00b6 For the purpose of this guide, let\u2019s consider we are in the case of a full HTML webpage, like the service given as an example in the template: books to scrape . There are few steps for a konnector to save data to Cozy Stack : Authentication Scrap and/or request data Parse and format data Save data to cozy stack In a client-side connector those steps are mainly done by the following three functions called by the ContentScript.js each and every time the konnector is triggered. ///////// //PILOT// async ensureAuthenticated () { // First step } async getUserDataFromWebsite () { // Second step & // Third step } async fetch ( context ) { // Fourth step } As mentionned, those three fundamental functions are called every time the konnector is executing, but it is up to you to custom them regarding your needs and the service you are expecting to take the data from. The pilot/worker principle \u00b6 A very specific and important notion to keep in mind: We are using two webviews to make a konnector run - a Pilot - and a Worker As explicit as the name can be, the Pilot treats with the cozy-stack, the Worker interacts with the webservice and sends information to the Pilot . Both accesses the ContentScript.js methods, but some methods are designed to be restricted (like runInWorker , only usable in the Pilot ) but we\u2019ll come to that in details during this tutorial. Authentication \u00b6 Open the src/index.js file, there are comments to guide you through it. The very first step is to be able to define if the user is authenticated to the remote service. This is done with: async ensureAuthenticated () {} As books.toscrape.com does not have any login form, let\u2019s say the remote service exposes a simple classical form like trainline.eu : < form id = \"signin-form\" novalidate = \"\" class = \"signin__form\" data-ember-action = \"\" data-ember-action-680 = \"680\" > < input name = \"email\" autocomplete = \"on\" placeholder = \"Email Address\" id = \"ember691\" class = \"ember-text-field textfield ember-view\" data-enpass . usermodified = \"yes\" type = \"email\" > < input name = \"password\" autocomplete = \"on\" placeholder = \"Password\" id = \"ember696\" class = \"ember-text-field textfield ember-view\" data-enpass . usermodified = \"yes\" type = \"password\" > < div class = \"signin__forgot\" > < span data-ember-action = \"\" data-ember-action-697 = \"697\" > < a href = \"/password\" id = \"ember698\" class = \"ember-view\" > Forgot your password? </ a > </ span > </ div > < div class = \"signin__buttons \" > < div class = \"signin__buttons-block\" > < button type = \"submit\" class = \"signin__button\" > Sign In </ button > </ div > </ div > </ form > At this point, you got to tell the Pilot to set the Worker on the wanted web page (baseUrl). To be sure the page is loaded properly, you need to wait for an HTML element (here, let\u2019s say it is the button leading you to the quotes page). async ensureAuthenticated () { await this . goto ( baseUrl ) // Set the worker on the baseUrl await this . waitForElementInWorker ( defaultSelector ) // Wait for quotes link element in the worker } Once waitForElementInWorker will respond, you try to click on this button and wait for another element telling you the page is loaded. Here we are waiting for either a button to a login page or the logout button. async ensureAuthenticated () { await this . goto ( baseUrl ) await this . waitForElementInWorker ( defaultSelector ) await this . runInWorker ( 'click' , defaultSelector ) // Click on quotes link element in the worker await Promise . race ([ this . waitForElementInWorker ( loginLinkSelector ), this . waitForElementInWorker ( logoutLinkSelector ) ]) // Wait for both logout or login link to be sure to check authentication when ready } When one of them is true, you need to check if the user is already logged in or not. If not, we trigger the showLoginFormAndWaitForAuthentication function. async ensureAuthenticated () { await this . goto ( baseUrl ) await this . waitForElementInWorker ( defaultSelector ) await this . runInWorker ( 'click' , defaultSelector ) await Promise . race ([ this . waitForElementInWorker ( loginLinkSelector ), this . waitForElementInWorker ( logoutLinkSelector ) ]) const authenticated = await this . runInWorker ( 'checkAuthenticated' ) // Checking authentication if ( ! authenticated ) { this . log ( 'not authenticated' ) await this . showLoginFormAndWaitForAuthentication () // Triggering the user authentication process } return true // Return true to continue konnector execution } The showLoginFormAndWaitForAuthentication function will remain at least like this: async showLoginFormAndWaitForAuthentication () { await this . setWorkerState ({ visible : true }) // Show the webview to the user await this . runInWorkerUntilTrue ({ method : 'waitForAuthenticated' }) // Wait for user to connect await this . setWorkerState ({ visible : false }) // Hide the webview to the user } You can always add more actions to it if you need so, but those three are mandatory. First will show to the user the Worker webview. Second will actually wait for the user manual authentication. This will trigger waitForAuthenticated which wait for checkAuthenticated to return true from the worker (more about it in an instant). This allows us to bypass eventual captcha/2FA or anti-bot securities. Last will hide the Worker webview from the user before continuing execution. async showLoginFormAndWaitForAuthentication () { log . debug ( 'showLoginFormAndWaitForAuthentication start' ) // You can add some logs of course await this . clickAndWait ( loginLinkSelector , '#username' ) // Or an action before or after . Here we clicking on the loginPage element and wait for the username input of the form await this . setWorkerState ({ visible : true }) await this . runInWorkerUntilTrue ({ method : 'waitForAuthenticated' }) await this . setWorkerState ({ visible : false }) } checkAuthenticated is a ContentScript.js method that you need to customize and it needs to return true at some point. This is a check to determine if the user login had been successful or not and as it is launched with runInWorkerUntilTrue , it will run again and again until\u2026 Well, until it responds true ! async checkAuthenticated () { if ( document . querySelector ( logoutLinkSelector )){ this . log ( 'Auth Check succeeded' ) return true } return false } In the block example above, if we find the logoutLinkSelector , it means the user is actually connected, so the function might return true . Getting the data \u00b6 Once the user has been authenticated, the konnector is able to navigate on the web service to fetch data. The most common case is that the documents, e.g. invoices, we want to fetch are listed in a HTML page. So to fetch data, we navigate to the target webpage that contains the invoices, just like a user would. But sometimes, the webpage is a JavaScript page that uses a JSON API URL. We\u2019ll cover this case later in this tutorial. First you need to customize the getUserDataFromWebsite function. Remember, any required action to access the data you are looking for, must be executed in the Worker webview. Some functions are already foreseen in the ContentScript , but for more complex action, you will need to make your own. So, how does it works? In this example, we wanna scrap data of the user but also the Music section. Let\u2019s start with the books section async getUserDataFromWebsite () { await this . runInWorker ( 'click' , musicSectionSelector ) // Calling ContentScript method 'click' in the worker await this . waitForElementInWorker ( sectionHeaderSelector ) } Now we need to check if the landing page is what we expected. On this website, one of the way to do this is to see if the element with the class section-header is containing the string \u201cMusic\u201d. To do this, we\u2019ll need a more powerful function than the ones we have in the ContentScript . Let\u2019s do this. First, you will need to declare this function to the ContentScript , so it knows it exist and it can be triggered. At the very bottom of the index.js , you can find the connector.init function taking one argument with an array additionalExposedMethodsNames . Everytime you will need to build a new function for the pilot to give to the worker, you will need to declare it in this array like so: connector . init ({ additionalExposedMethodsNames : [ 'checkIfRightPage' , ] }) Now it is done, we can give it to the Worker : async getUserDataFromWebsite () { await this . runInWorker ( 'click' , musicSectionSelector ) await this . waitForElementInWorker ( sectionHeaderSelector ) await this . runInWorker ( 'checkIfRightPage' ) } And define what the function will do. // Homemade function can be async too checkIfRightPage () { const selectorContent = document . querySelector ( sectionHeaderSelector ). textContent . trim () if ( selectorContent === \"Music\" ){ return true } return false } At this point, your new function should return true, so let\u2019s continue. Because you are checking and returning a value, you can now decide what to do depending on the response. async getUserDataFromWebsite () { await this . runInWorker ( 'click' , musicSectionSelector ) await this . waitForElementInWorker ( sectionHeaderSelector ) const isRight = await this . runInWorker ( 'checkIfRightPage' ) if ( isRight ){ let await this . runInWorker ( 'getBooksData' ) // Another custom function, with an argument } else { throw new Error ( 'Something went wrong when accessing the Music section' ) } } Dont forget to declare it! connector . init ({ additionalExposedMethodsNames : [ 'checkIfRightPage' , 'getBooksData' , ] }) And define what it will do. getBooksData () { const bookList = document . querySelectorAll ( musicBooksSelector ) allBooks = [] for ( const book of bookList ){ const aBook = book . children [ 0 ] const title = aBook . children [ 2 ]. children [ 0 ]. getAttribute ( 'title' ) const starRating = aBook . children [ 1 ]. getAttribute ( 'class' ). split ( ' ' )[ 1 ] const price = aBook . children [ 3 ]. children [ 0 ]. textContent const inStock = aBook . children [ 3 ]. children [ 1 ]. textContent . includes ( 'In stock' ) const fileurl = aBook . children [ 3 ]. children [ 2 ]. getAttribute ( 'href' ) const filename = ` ${ title . replace ( / /g , '-' ) } _ ${ starRating } -stars_ ${ price } .pdf` const newBook = { fileurl , filename , title , starRating , price , inStock } allBooks . push ( newBook ) } await this . sendToPilot ({ allBooks }) } Once you are at the Worker level, if you need more functions, these ones do not need to be declared in additionalExposedMethodsNames , just add it into the Class. Now the Music section has been scraped and the result of this scraping is returned and stored in the musicBooks variable, let\u2019s do the same for the user data. async getUserDataFromWebsite () { await this . runInWorker ( 'click' , musicSectionSelector ) await this . waitForElementInWorker ( sectionHeaderSelector ) const isRight = await this . runInWorker ( 'checkIfRightPage' ) if ( isRight ){ await this . runInWorker ( 'getMusicBooksData' ) await this . clickAndWait ( personnalInfoSectionSelector , sectionHeaderSelector ) // Once again you can test the page, we won't do this here for clarity await this . runInWorker ( 'getUserData' ) // One more custom function } else { throw new Error ( 'Something went wrong when accessing the Music section' ) } } Never forget to declare it. connector . init ({ additionalExposedMethodsNames : [ 'checkIfRightPage' , 'getMusicBooksData' , 'getUserData' , ] }) And define what it will do. In this website, there is no possible login so there is no user\u2019s information page. We\u2019ll just act like there is one. getUserData () { const userInfos = document . querySelector ( userInfosSelector ) const name = userInfos . children [ 0 ] const [ firstName , lastName ] = name . split ( ' ' ) const [ street , city , postCode , country ] = userInfos . children [ 1 ]. textContent . split ( ',' ) const mobilePhoneNumber = userInfos . children [ 2 ]. textContent const email = userInfos . children [ 3 ]. textContent // This is the standard format for a cozy identity const userIdentity = { email , name : { firstName , lastName , fullName = ` ${ firstName } ${ lastName } ` }, address : [ { formattedAddress : userInfos . address , street , city , postCode , country } ], phone : [ { type : 'mobile' , number : mobilePhoneNumber } ] } await this . sendToPilot ( userIdentity ) } There we have both wanted data, let\u2019s speak about the sendToPilot . As mentioned earlier, the Pilot do not see what\u2019s happening in the Worker . It cannot access the page like the Worker does so it cannot find and manipulate the data by itself. It is a way for us to ensure that there is no communication between the website and your cozy. The Pilot is the only one who can save data into your cozy, but the Worker is the only one who can access this data. The only way to access any type of data manipulation in the Pilot is to pass the data from the Worker to the Pilot . This is done with sendToPilot . This function will trigger a storeFromWorker function on the Pilot side and will save the data into the store . You will be able to access this data anywhere in the execution now, in the Pilot with this.store and in the Worker when passing the store as an argument of a function. To properly finish the getUserDataFromWebsite function, the stack is waiting for a sourceAccountIdentifier to get returned. If you found an email while scraping the user\u2019s data, it is usually what is used. If you don\u2019t end up with an email for some reason, you got to define at the beginning of the code a DEFAULT_SOURCE_ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER with the vendor\u2019s name. const DEFAULT_SOURCE_ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER = \"bookstoscrape\" async getUserDataFromWebsite () { await this . runInWorker ( 'click' , musicSectionSelector ) await this . waitForElementInWorker ( sectionHeaderSelector ) const isRight = await this . runInWorker ( 'checkIfRightPage' ) if ( isRight ){ await this . runInWorker ( 'getMusicBooksData' ) await this . clickAndWait ( personnalInfoSectionSelector , sectionHeaderSelector ) await this . runInWorker ( 'getUserData' ) } if ( this . store . userIdentity . email ){ // getUserData is supposed to have sent the userIdentity to the pilot, so we check the store return { sourceAccountIdentifier : this . store . userIdentity . email } } else { this . log ( \"Couldn't get a sourceAccountIdentifier, using default\" ) return { sourceAccountIdentifier : DEFAULT_SOURCE_ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER } } } Well done, you just finished the data part! Now let\u2019s save it with the fetch method, the last step in freeing your data with a client-side konnector. Saving the data \u00b6 Saving data is pretty easy after the work done above and it\u2019s done within fetch . async fetch ( context ) {} One thing you will need everytime when you save files in your cozy is the context . This allows the Pilot to use the same context as the Worker , meaning the download call will look like it is made from the same webview as the navigation was made. Next, you have some questions to ask to yourself before actually saving those data on your cozy. What kind of data is it? For now, we\u2019ll consider you are dealing with files. You need to define if the file you are about to save is either a bill or a file . The specificity of the bill is that it represents actual invoices. It could be linked to operations in your Cozy Banks, but it will need some data like an amount and a vendor added . Here we gonna save the books \u201cthemselves\u201d, as there is no actual file to download, we\u2019ll pretend we\u2019re saving the .pdf of the books so let\u2019s go with a saveFiles . What is the content-type of the file? Usually something you can find in headers, describing what type of content is supposed to be downloaded. For us it\u2019s a pdf , but it can be anything : zip, photos, excel sheets \u2026 What will be the attribute on which the deduplication will base its logic? The fileIdAttribute will use the given attribute to know if the file needed to be saved or if it had already been downloaded. The simpliest way to differentiate two files is by their name, but in some cases (like linked bills ) you will need something more revelant for the linking operation to hold all the bills for a same month and still save one file per month. What is the qualification label for these documents? Cozy follows certains conventions regarding the documents qualification. You can find the list of available qualifications and see if something is fitting your needs. Those qualification attributes are very useful to enrich the fetched documents with metadata and use them in apps. Here, let\u2019s use a fictive qualification label, named \u201cdigital_book\u201d. async fetch ( context ) { this . log ( \"fetch starts\" ) // Passing our scraping result containing all our books and their data to saveFiles // And options Object with the answers of our interrogations await this . saveFiles ( this . store . allBooks , { context , contentType : 'application/pdf' , fileIdAttributes : [ 'filename' ], qualificationLabel : 'digital_book' }) } If needed, you can add some actions in fetch before or after the saveFiles . Here we\u2019ll pretend we need to disconnect from the webservice after retrieving the data. For that, we can simply click on the logout button in the worker and wait for the button leading you to the login form. async fetch ( context ) { this . log ( \"fetch starts\" ) // Passing our scraping result containing all our books and their data to saveFiles // And options Object with the answers of our interrogations await this . saveFiles ( this . store . allBooks , { context , contentType : 'application/pdf' , fileIdAttributes : [ 'filename' ], qualificationLabel : 'digital_book' }) await this . clickAndWait ( logoutButtonSelector , loginButtonSelector ) } And that\u2019s all done! You successfully saved your data, you now have new books to read in your cozy! This is the basics of freeing your data with a client-side konnector. In the future, we will address a topic about more specific cases requiring other ContentScript methods and other technics to get back what you own (your data, right ?). To wrap up, this is what your konnector should look like all together: const DEFAULT_SOURCE_ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER = \"bookstoscrape\" class TemplateContentScript extends ContentScript { ////////// //PILOT // ////////// async ensureAuthenticated () { await this . goto ( baseUrl ) await this . waitForElementInWorker ( defaultSelector ) await this . runInWorker ( 'click' , defaultSelector ) await Promise . race ([ this . waitForElementInWorker ( loginLinkSelector ), this . waitForElementInWorker ( logoutLinkSelector ) ]) const authenticated = await this . runInWorker ( 'checkAuthenticated' ) if ( ! authenticated ) { this . log ( 'not authenticated' ) await this . showLoginFormAndWaitForAuthentication () } return true } async showLoginFormAndWaitForAuthentication () { log . debug ( 'showLoginFormAndWaitForAuthentication start' ) await this . clickAndWait ( loginLinkSelector , '#username' ) await this . setWorkerState ({ visible : true }) await this . runInWorkerUntilTrue ({ method : 'waitForAuthenticated' }) await this . setWorkerState ({ visible : false }) } async getUserDataFromWebsite () { await this . runInWorker ( 'click' , musicSectionSelector ) await this . waitForElementInWorker ( sectionHeaderSelector ) const isRight = await this . runInWorker ( 'checkIfRightPage' ) if ( isRight ){ await this . runInWorker ( 'getMusicBooksData' ) await this . clickAndWait ( personnalInfoSectionSelector , sectionHeaderSelector ) await this . runInWorker ( 'getUserData' ) } if ( this . store . userIdentity . email ){ return { sourceAccountIdentifier : this . store . userIdentity . email } } else { this . log ( \"Couldn't get a sourceAccountIdentifier, using default\" ) return { sourceAccountIdentifier : DEFAULT_SOURCE_ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER } } } async fetch ( context ) { this . log ( \"fetch starts\" ) await this . saveFiles ( this . store . allBooks , { context , contentType : 'application/pdf' , fileIdAttributes : [ 'filename' ], qualificationLabel : 'digital_book' }) await this . clickAndWait ( logoutButtonSelector , loginButtonSelector ) } ////////// //WORKER// ////////// async checkAuthenticated () { if ( document . querySelector ( logoutLinkSelector )){ this . log ( 'Auth Check succeeded' ) return true } return false } checkIfRightPage () { const selectorContent = document . querySelector ( sectionHeaderSelector ). textContent . trim () if ( selectorContent === \"Music\" ){ return true } return false } getUserData () { const userInfos = document . querySelector ( userInfosSelector ) const name = userInfos . children [ 0 ] const [ firstName , lastName ] = name . split ( ' ' ) const [ street , city , postCode , country ] = userInfos . children [ 1 ]. textContent . split ( ',' ) const mobilePhoneNumber = userInfos . children [ 2 ]. textContent const email = userInfos . children [ 3 ]. textContent const userIdentity = { email , name : { firstName , lastName , fullName = ` ${ firstName } ${ lastName } ` }, address : [ { formattedAddress : userInfos . address , street , city , postCode , country } ], phone : [ { type : 'mobile' , number : mobilePhoneNumber } ] } await this . sendToPilot ( userIdentity ) } } connector . init ({ additionalExposedMethodsNames : [ 'checkIfRightPage' , 'getMusicBooksData' , 'getUserData' , ] }). catch ( err => { console . warn ( err ) })", "title": "Scrape data"}, {"location": "tutorials/client-side-konnector/scrape-data/#implement-your-konnector", "text": "For the purpose of this guide, let\u2019s consider we are in the case of a full HTML webpage, like the service given as an example in the template: books to scrape .

Because you are checking and returning a value, you can now decide what to do depending on the response. async getUserDataFromWebsite () { await this . runInWorker ( 'click' , musicSectionSelector ) await this . waitForElementInWorker ( sectionHeaderSelector ) const isRight = await this . runInWorker ( 'checkIfRightPage' ) if ( isRight ){ let await this . runInWorker ( 'getBooksData' ) // Another custom function, with an argument } else { throw new Error ( 'Something went wrong when accessing the Music section' ) } } Dont forget to declare it! connector . init ({ additionalExposedMethodsNames : [ 'checkIfRightPage' , 'getBooksData' , ] }) And define what it will do. getBooksData () { const bookList = document . querySelectorAll ( musicBooksSelector ) allBooks = [] for ( const book of bookList ){ const aBook = book . children [ 0 ] const title = aBook . children [ 2 ]. children [ 0 ]. getAttribute ( 'title' ) const starRating = aBook . children [ 1 ]. getAttribute ( 'class' ). split ( ' ' )[ 1 ] const price = aBook . children [ 3 ]. children [ 0 ]. textContent const inStock = aBook . children [ 3 ]. children [ 1 ]. textContent . includes ( 'In stock' ) const fileurl = aBook . children [ 3 ]. children [ 2 ]. getAttribute ( 'href' ) const filename = ` ${ title . replace ( / /g , '-' ) } _ ${ starRating } -stars_ ${ price } .pdf` const newBook = { fileurl , filename , title , starRating , price , inStock } allBooks . push ( newBook ) } await this . sendToPilot ({ allBooks }) } Once you are at the Worker level, if you need more functions, these ones do not need to be declared in additionalExposedMethodsNames , just add it into the Class. Now the Music section has been scraped and the result of this scraping is returned and stored in the musicBooks variable, let\u2019s do the same for the user data. async getUserDataFromWebsite () { await this . runInWorker ( 'click' , musicSectionSelector ) await this . waitForElementInWorker ( sectionHeaderSelector ) const isRight = await this . runInWorker ( 'checkIfRightPage' ) if ( isRight ){ await this . runInWorker ( 'getMusicBooksData' ) await this . clickAndWait ( personnalInfoSectionSelector , sectionHeaderSelector ) // Once again you can test the page, we won't do this here for clarity await this . runInWorker ( 'getUserData' ) // One more custom function } else { throw new Error ( 'Something went wrong when accessing the Music section' ) } } Never forget to declare it. connector . init ({ additionalExposedMethodsNames : [ 'checkIfRightPage' , 'getMusicBooksData' , 'getUserData' , ] }) And define what it will do. In this website, there is no possible login so there is no user\u2019s information page. We\u2019ll just act like there is one. getUserData () { const userInfos = document . querySelector ( userInfosSelector ) const name = userInfos . children [ 0 ] const [ firstName , lastName ] = name . split ( ' ' ) const [ street , city , postCode , country ] = userInfos . children [ 1 ]. textContent . split ( ',' ) const mobilePhoneNumber = userInfos . children [ 2 ]. textContent const email = userInfos . children [ 3 ]. textContent // This is the standard format for a cozy identity const userIdentity = { email , name : { firstName , lastName , fullName = ` ${ firstName } ${ lastName } ` }, address : [ { formattedAddress : userInfos . address , street , city , postCode , country } ], phone : [ { type : 'mobile' , number : mobilePhoneNumber } ] } await this . sendToPilot ( userIdentity ) } There we have both wanted data, let\u2019s speak about the sendToPilot . As mentioned earlier, the Pilot do not see what\u2019s happening in the Worker . It cannot access the page like the Worker does so it cannot find and manipulate the data by itself. It is a way for us to ensure that there is no communication between the website and your cozy. The Pilot is the only one who can save data into your cozy, but the Worker is the only one who can access this data. The only way to access any type of data manipulation in the Pilot is to pass the data from the Worker to the Pilot . This is done with sendToPilot . This function will trigger a storeFromWorker function on the Pilot side and will save the data into the store . You will be able to access this data anywhere in the execution now, in the Pilot with this.store and in the Worker when passing the store as an argument of a function. To properly finish the getUserDataFromWebsite function, the stack is waiting for a sourceAccountIdentifier to get returned. If you found an email while scraping the user\u2019s data, it is usually what is used. If you don\u2019t end up with an email for some reason, you got to define at the beginning of the code a DEFAULT_SOURCE_ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER with the vendor\u2019s name. const DEFAULT_SOURCE_ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER = \"bookstoscrape\" async getUserDataFromWebsite () { await this . runInWorker ( 'click' , musicSectionSelector ) await this . waitForElementInWorker ( sectionHeaderSelector ) const isRight = await this . runInWorker ( 'checkIfRightPage' ) if ( isRight ){ await this . runInWorker ( 'getMusicBooksData' ) await this . clickAndWait ( personnalInfoSectionSelector , sectionHeaderSelector ) await this . runInWorker ( 'getUserData' ) } if ( this . store . userIdentity . email ){ // getUserData is supposed to have sent the userIdentity to the pilot, so we check the store return { sourceAccountIdentifier : this . store . userIdentity . email } } else { this . log ( \"Couldn't get a sourceAccountIdentifier, using default\" ) return { sourceAccountIdentifier : DEFAULT_SOURCE_ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER } } } Well done, you just finished the data part! Now let\u2019s save it with the fetch method, the last step in freeing your data with a client-side konnector.", "title": "Getting the data"}, {"location": "tutorials/client-side-konnector/scrape-data/#saving-the-data", "text": "Saving data is pretty easy after the work done above and it\u2019s done within fetch . async fetch ( context ) {} One thing you will need everytime when you save files in your cozy is the context . This allows the Pilot to use the same context as the Worker , meaning the download call will look like it is made from the same webview as the navigation was made. Next, you have some questions to ask to yourself before actually saving those data on your cozy. What kind of data is it? For now, we\u2019ll consider you are dealing with files. You need to define if the file you are about to save is either a bill or a file . The specificity of the bill is that it represents actual invoices. It could be linked to operations in your Cozy Banks, but it will need some data like an amount and a vendor added . Here we gonna save the books \u201cthemselves\u201d, as there is no actual file to download, we\u2019ll pretend we\u2019re saving the .pdf of the books so let\u2019s go with a saveFiles . What is the content-type of the file? Usually something you can find in headers, describing what type of content is supposed to be downloaded. For us it\u2019s a pdf , but it can be anything : zip, photos, excel sheets \u2026 What will be the attribute on which the deduplication will base its logic? The fileIdAttribute will use the given attribute to know if the file needed to be saved or if it had already been downloaded. The simpliest way to differentiate two files is by their name, but in some cases (like linked bills ) you will need something more revelant for the linking operation to hold all the bills for a same month and still save one file per month. What is the qualification label for these documents? Cozy follows certains conventions regarding the documents qualification. You can find the list of available qualifications and see if something is fitting your needs. Those qualification attributes are very useful to enrich the fetched documents with metadata and use them in apps. Here, let\u2019s use a fictive qualification label, named \u201cdigital_book\u201d. async fetch ( context ) { this . log ( \"fetch starts\" ) // Passing our scraping result containing all our books and their data to saveFiles // And options Object with the answers of our interrogations await this . saveFiles ( this . store . allBooks , { context , contentType : 'application/pdf' , fileIdAttributes : [ 'filename' ], qualificationLabel : 'digital_book' }) } If needed, you can add some actions in fetch before or after the saveFiles . Here we\u2019ll pretend we need to disconnect from the webservice after retrieving the data. For that, we can simply click on the logout button in the worker and wait for the button leading you to the login form. async fetch ( context ) { this . log ( \"fetch starts\" ) // Passing our scraping result containing all our books and their data to saveFiles // And options Object with the answers of our interrogations await this . saveFiles ( this . store . allBooks , { context , contentType : 'application/pdf' , fileIdAttributes : [ 'filename' ], qualificationLabel : 'digital_book' }) await this . clickAndWait ( logoutButtonSelector , loginButtonSelector ) } And that\u2019s all done! You successfully saved your data, you now have new books to read in your cozy! This is the basics of freeing your data with a client-side konnector. In the future, we will address a topic about more specific cases requiring other ContentScript methods and other technics to get back what you own (your data, right ?). To wrap up, this is what your konnector should look like all together: const DEFAULT_SOURCE_ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER = \"bookstoscrape\" class TemplateContentScript extends ContentScript { ////////// //PILOT // ////////// async ensureAuthenticated () { await this . goto ( baseUrl ) await this . waitForElementInWorker ( defaultSelector ) await this . runInWorker ( 'click' , defaultSelector ) await Promise . race ([ this . waitForElementInWorker ( loginLinkSelector ), this . waitForElementInWorker ( logoutLinkSelector ) ]) const authenticated = await this . runInWorker ( 'checkAuthenticated' ) if ( ! authenticated ) { this . log ( 'not authenticated' ) await this . showLoginFormAndWaitForAuthentication () } return true } async showLoginFormAndWaitForAuthentication () { log . debug ( 'showLoginFormAndWaitForAuthentication start' ) await this . clickAndWait ( loginLinkSelector , '#username' ) await this . setWorkerState ({ visible : true }) await this . runInWorkerUntilTrue ({ method : 'waitForAuthenticated' }) await this . setWorkerState ({ visible : false }) } async getUserDataFromWebsite () { await this . runInWorker ( 'click' , musicSectionSelector ) await this . waitForElementInWorker ( sectionHeaderSelector ) const isRight = await this . runInWorker ( 'checkIfRightPage' ) if ( isRight ){ await this . runInWorker ( 'getMusicBooksData' ) await this . clickAndWait ( personnalInfoSectionSelector , sectionHeaderSelector ) await this . runInWorker ( 'getUserData' ) } if ( this . store . userIdentity . email ){ return { sourceAccountIdentifier : this . store . userIdentity . email } } else { this . log ( \"Couldn't get a sourceAccountIdentifier, using default\" ) return { sourceAccountIdentifier : DEFAULT_SOURCE_ACCOUNT_IDENTIFIER } } } async fetch ( context ) { this . log ( \"fetch starts\" ) await this . saveFiles ( this . store . allBooks , { context , contentType : 'application/pdf' , fileIdAttributes : [ 'filename' ], qualificationLabel : 'digital_book' }) await this . clickAndWait ( logoutButtonSelector , loginButtonSelector ) } ////////// //WORKER// ////////// async checkAuthenticated () { if ( document . querySelector ( logoutLinkSelector )){ this . log ( 'Auth Check succeeded' ) return true } return false } checkIfRightPage () { const selectorContent = document . querySelector ( sectionHeaderSelector ). textContent . trim () if ( selectorContent === \"Music\" ){ return true } return false } getUserData () { const userInfos = document . querySelector ( userInfosSelector ) const name = userInfos . children [ 0 ] const [ firstName , lastName ] = name . split ( ' ' ) const [ street , city , postCode , country ] = userInfos . children [ 1 ]. textContent . split ( ',' ) const mobilePhoneNumber = userInfos . children [ 2 ]. textContent const email = userInfos . children [ 3 ]. textContent const userIdentity = { email , name : { firstName , lastName , fullName = ` ${ firstName } ${ lastName } ` }, address : [ { formattedAddress : userInfos . address , street , city , postCode , country } ], phone : [ { type : 'mobile' , number : mobilePhoneNumber } ] } await this . sendToPilot ( userIdentity ) } } connector . init ({ additionalExposedMethodsNames : [ 'checkIfRightPage' , 'getMusicBooksData' , 'getUserData' , ] }). catch ( err => { console . warn ( err ) })", "title": "Saving the data"}, {"location": "tutorials/cloudery/", "text": "Cloudery \u00b6 This documentation explain how to use our Cloudery API to create and manager your own Cozy.

This is organized as follows: Queries PouchDB Doctypes Qualification Advanced", "title": "Introduction"}, {"location": "tutorials/data/advanced/", "text": "Advanced concepts \u00b6 Indexes: concepts \u00b6 But why, though? \u00b6 In order to efficiently filter documents through selectors and sort them, it is important to correctly index data. An index is a way to organize documents in order to retrieve them faster. To give a simple and non-database comparison, a recipe book might have an index listing all the recipes by their name with their page number. If the reader is looking for a particular recipe, this index avoids him to scan the full book to find it. The principle is the same for databases index: we want to avoid scanning the whole database each time we are looking for specific data expressed by a selector: even though computers are way faster than humans to scan data, this task can be very time-consuming when dealing with thousands or millions of documents. In more formal terms, time complexity of a query run on a database with n documents will be O(n) without index, as it requires to scan all documents. In CouchDB, the indexes are actually B+ Trees , a structure derived from the B-Trees , that perform in O(log(n)) in average, which guarantees a very fast access time even in large datasets. From a practical point of view, B-trees, therefore, guarantee an access time of less than 10 ms even for extremely large datasets. \u2014Dr. Rudolf Bayer, inventor of the B-tree B+ Tree \u00b6 CouchDB indexes are B+ Trees. It means that indexed fields, here keys , are organized as a tree, with the documents stored in the leafs nodes. So, finding a particular document means browsing the tree, from the root to the leaf. In each node, a key has two children: the left child has all its keys inferior to the parent, while the right child has all its keys superior to the parent. In the Figure below, borrowed from the CouchDB guide , you see that each node has three keys. In CouchDB implementation, a B+ Tree node can actually store more than 1600 keys. B+ Tree This design is very efficient for range queries: in the example above, a query looking for documents having an indexed field between 1 and 3 will browse the tree to find the first document position (with a key of 1) and then get the next two contiguous documents. \u2139\ufe0f CouchDB has an append-only design: it means that there is no in-place update. Each time a document is updated, its new version is appended to the database file, and the B+ Tree is updated to reflect the change. \u2139\ufe0f It is not necessary to master the B+ Tree logic to query data, but it is good to at least be aware of the main concepts to understand the indexing logic, especially when designing complex queries. \u2139\ufe0f When indexing several document fields in the same index, the key is actually an array of those fields, e.g. an index on [\"category\", \"created_at\"] would give keys such as [\"sport\", \"2019-01-01\"] . \u2139\ufe0f A key does not have to be unique. Actually, it is often useful to group document per key, e.g. a category key can return many document with the same key value, like sport , work , etc. Indexes: why is my document not being retrieved? \u00b6 At indexing time, CouchDB evaluates if a new document should be indexed by checking if its fields match an existing index. It means that all the indexed fields must exist in the document to index it. It can be problematic for queries that need to check if a particular field exists or not. For example, this query won\u2019t work: const queryDef = client . find ( \"io.cozy.todos\" ) . where ({ category : { $exists : false , }, }) . indexFields ([ \"category\" ]); Here, we want to get all the todos without a category field. However, those documents will never be indexed, precisely because the field is missing. Hence, think carefully about your data before hand and do not use queries with $exists: false whenever possible. If a field is missing, it might be better to add a null value so that your documents do not have any missing fields. If this is not possible for some reasons, here is another possible solution - yet not very efficient: \u26a0\ufe0f Not efficient workaround const queryDef = client . find ( \"io.cozy.todos\" ) . where ({ _id : { $gt : null , }, category : { $exists : false , }, }) . indexFields ([ \"_id\" ]); Here, we force an index on the _id , which always exists in any CouchDB document, and ask all the documents with \"_id\": { \"$gt\": null } . The category is not indexed so the documents without this field will enter the index. This is not efficient as it implies that the \"category\": { \"$exists\": false } condition will be evaluated in memory by CouchDB for all the documents of the database, thus making a full index scan. Indexes: performances and design \u00b6 When designing indexes on several fields, one should keep in mind that they are actually B+ Tree, as explained in this section . This can be helpful to design efficient queries and avoid performance traps. To illustrate this, let\u2019s assume you have declared this query, to get all the \u201cwork\u201d todos created in 2019: const queryDef = client . find ( \"io.cozy.todos\" ) . where ({ created_at : { $ge : \"2019-01-01\" , $lt : \"2020-01-01\" , }, category : \"work\" , }) . indexFields ([ \"created_at\" , \"category\" ]); \u26a0\ufe0f This query is actually sub-optimal. To understand this, let\u2019s represent some sample data: created_at category 2019-01-01 family 2019-01-01 sport 2019-01-01 work 2019-01-01 work 2019-01-02 work 2019-01-03 sport 2019-01-04 work \u2026 \u2026 2020-01-01 family This shows how the data is organized in the index: it is primarily sorted by created_at and then by category . First, the query is looking for all the todos starting from \"2019-01-01\" and before \"2020-01-01\" . It easily finds this range in the B+ Tree; but now it must also filter all the results to only keep the rows with category: work . And this cannot be done through the B+ Tree, because matching rows are not contiguous, as shown in green in the table: this means that CouchDB is forced to perform the category condition in memory, leading to bad performances. \ud83d\udca1 Hopefully, this example can be easily be solved by switching the index fields order: .indexFields([\"category\", \"created_at\"]) The data is now organized as follow: category created_at family 2019-01-01 ... ... sport 2019-01-01 ... ... work 2019-01-01 work 2019-01-01 work 2019-01-02 work 2019-01-03 work 2019-01-04 \u2026 \u2026 work 2020-01-01 Now, the very same query can be efficiently processed: the category: work is first evaluated in the B+ Tree, which return all the relevant rows, sorted by created_at . Then, the range is easily found now that all the rows are contiguous. \ud83d\udca1 The main takeaway here is: when dealing with a query with both equality and range, you must first index the equality field. If you are interested about this, you can learn more here . Even though it is SQL-oriented, it also applies for CouchDB as the B-Tree indexing logic is the same. \ud83d\udca1 When creating an index, carefully think about how your data will be organized and which query will need to perfom. The performances can dramatically vary depending on your design, with several orders of magnitude. \ud83d\udca1 The problematic and consequences of the not contiguous rows is further explain in the partial indexes section . Partial indexes \u00b6 In CouchDB, a document is indexed only if its fields matches an existing index. As a consequence, it is not possible to perform efficient queries on non-existing fields. For instance, the query below does not work, because it searches for document without the category field, but the absence of this field will cause such documents to never be indexed, as previously explained here : const queryDef = client . find ( \"io.cozy.todos\" ) . where ({ category : { $exists : false , }, }) . indexFields ([ \"category\" ]); In the same manner, queries implying non-contiguous rows in the B+ Tree are sub-optimal. Typically, queries with a non-egal operator, $ne : const queryDef = client . find ( \"io.cozy.todos\" ) . where ({ title : \"Exercices\" , category : { $ne : \"sport\" , }, }) . indexFields ([ \"title\" , \"category\" ]); As the $ne operator cannot guarantee contiguous rows, it needs to scan all the index on documents with the \"title\": \"Exercices\" to find those that are not in the sport category . Partial indexes are a way to circumvent this issue. They allow to define a partial selector condition that will be evaluated at the indexing time, and will add the document in the index if it matches the condition. Thanks to this, it becomes possible to tell CouchDB at indexing time to exlude documents that do not match the condition, e.g. \"category\": { \"$exists\": false} or \"category\": { \"$ne\": \"sport\"} . Hence, the produced index will only include documents that already matched the partial filter selector, making it possible to query them, as this selector enforces contiguous rows or documents with missing fields. You can declare a partial index in cozy-client like this: const queryDef = client . find ( \"io.cozy.todos\" ) . where ({ title : \"Exercices\" , }) . partialIndex ({ category : { $ne : \"sport\" , }, }) . indexFields ([ \"title\" ]); partialIndex supports the same syntax than the where , so you can easily move inefficient selectors into partial indexes. Note in this example, it is no longer necessary to index the category field, as the field is now evaluated at indexing time, rather than during the query. Hence, a partial index is also useful to design less heavy indexes. Mango pagination: performances \u00b6 With mango queries, the recommanded method to paginate is through the bookmark parameter. However, one could also notice the skip parameter in the CouchDB API and be tempted to paginate with it. We detail here why you should never use skip to paginate and use bookmark instead. We explain it for exhaustiveness and to prevent developers to fall into this trap. This method consists of specifying a limit to the query, which is the maximum number of documents to return, and a skip parameter that is the number of documents returned so far. With cozy-client, its is expressed through limitBy and offset . \u26a0\ufe0f Do not use this: const docs = []; let resp = { next : true , data : [] }; while ( resp && resp . next ) { resp = await client . query ( Q ( \"io.cozy.todos\" ). limitBy ( 200 ). offset ( resp . data . length ) ); docs . push (... resp . data ); } This method is very bad for performances because it actually breaks the B+ Tree indexing logic: there is no way to efficiently skip a fixed number of data in such a tree, so skipping documents consists of normally running the query and then splitting the results starting from the skip number of documents. Thus, the performances quickly degrade when there are many documents to skip. On the contrary, the bookmark method is very efficient as it preserves the B+ Tree logic. One can see a bookmark as a pointer to start the query in the tree. \ud83d\udca1 Use this: const docs = []; let resp = { next : true }; while ( resp && resp . next ) { resp = await client . query ( Q ( \"io.cozy.todos\" ). limitBy ( 200 ). offsetBookmark ( resp . bookmark ) ); docs . push (... resp . data ); } Views: performances \u00b6 In Cozy, we disabled by default the possibility to create views from applications. This is because we experienced severe performances issues as soon as several views were used: building the views is very slow. This is mainly because CouchDB itself is written in Erlang, while views are JavaScript UDF and are executed in isolated JavaScript query processes to serialize the map-reduce functions. The communication between thoses processes and CouchDB is done through stdio , which is synchronous and thus require to process one doc at a time. For more details, see this great blog post from a CouchDB contributor. See also the CouchDB benchmark we performed. As quoted from the CouchDB documentation : Views with the JavaScript query server are extremely slow to generate when there are a non-trivial number of documents to process. A 10 million document database took about 4 hours to do view generation Let alone the very slow indexing time, this also requires a lot of server CPU to build views. Hence, applications cannot create views to ensure the scalability of Cozy. \u2139\ufe0f Mango queries are directly interpreted in Erlang and therefore do not suffer from the same limitations. \u274c It is possible to express views in Erlang and thus circumvent this performance issues. However, this is completely forbidden in Cozy, because of the security: doing so requires to enable the Erlang query server that needs root access to the CouchDB server, as explained in the CouchDB documentation . This would break the isolation system and let open the possibilty to define adversary UDF functions. Views: pagination \u00b6 The CouchDB views does not implement the Mango queries bookmark system. However, it is still possible to paginate results efficiently by using a cursor . This method, described in the CouchDB documentation , combines the startkey and startkey_docid parameters. For each query, get the last returned document and extract the searched key as well as the _id to respectively set the next startkey and startkey_docid query parameters. See this cursor pagination example in cozy-client. Revisions \u00b6 CouchDB keeps for each document a list of its revision (or more exactly a tree with replication and conflicts). It\u2019s possible to ask to the cozy-stack the list of the old revisions of a document with [GET /db/{docid}?revs_info=true](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/document/common.html#get--db-docid) . It works only if the document has not been deleted. For a deleted document, a trick is to query the changes feed to know the last revision of the document, and to recreate the document from this revision. With an old revision, it\u2019s possible to get the content of the document at this revision with GET /db/{docid}?rev={rev} if the database was not compacted. On CouchDB 3.x, compaction happen automatically on all databases from times to times. A purge operation consists to remove the tombstone for the deleted documents. It is a manual operation, triggered by a [POST /db/_purge](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/database/misc.html) . Conflicts \u00b6 It is possible to create a conflict on CouchDB like it does for the replication by using new_edits: false , but it is not well documented to say the least. The more accurate description was in the old wiki, that no longer exists . Here is a copy of what it said: The replicator uses a special mode of _bulk_docs. The documents it writes to the destination database already have revision IDs that need to be preserved for the two databases to be in sync (otherwise it would not be possible to tell that the two represent the same revision.) To prevent the database from assigning them new revision IDs, a \u201cnew_edits\u201d:false property is added to the JSON request body. Note that this changes the interpretation of the _rev parameter in each document: rather than being the parent revision ID to be matched against, it\u2019s the existing revision ID that will be saved as-is into the database. And since it\u2019s important to retain revision history when adding to the database, each document body in this mode should have a _revisions property that lists its revision history; the format of this property is described on the HTTP document API. For example: curl -X POST -d '{\"new_edits\":false,\"docs\":[{\"_id\":\"person\",\"_rev\":\"2-3595405\",\"_revisions\":{\"start\":2,\"ids\":[\"3595405\",\"877727288\"]},\"name\":\"jim\"}]}' \"$OTHER_DB/_bulk_docs\" This command will replicate one of the revisions created above, into a separate database OTHER_DB . It will have the same revision ID as in DB , 2-3595405 , and it will be known to have a parent revision with ID 1-877727288 . (Even though OTHER_DB will not have the body of that revision, the history will help it detect conflicts in future replications.) As with _all_or_nothing, this mode can create conflicts; in fact, this is where the conflicts created by replication come from. In short, it\u2019s a PUT /doc/{id}?new_edits=false with _rev the new revision of the document, and _revisions the parents of this revision in the revisions tree of this document. Conflict example Here is an example of a CouchDB conflict. Let\u2019s assume the following document with the revision history [1-abc, 2-def] saved in database: { \"_id\" : \"foo\" , \"_rev\" : \"2-def\" , \"bar\" : \"tender\" , \"_revisions\" : { \"ids\" : [ \"def\" , \"abc\" ] } } The _revisions block is returned when passing revs=true to the query and gives all the revision ids, which the revision part after the dash. For instance, in 2-def , 2 is called the \u201cgeneration\u201d and def the \u201cid\u201d. We update the document with a POST /bulk_docs query, with the following content: { \"docs\" : [ { \"_id\" : \"foo\" , \"_rev\" : \"3-ghi\" , \"_revisions\" : { \"start\" : 3 , \"ids\" : [ \"ghi\" , \"xyz\" , \"abc\" ] }, \"bar\" : \"racuda\" } ], \"new_edits\" : false } This produces a conflict bewteen 2-def and 2-xyz : the former was first saved in database, but we forced the latter to be a new child of 1-abc . Hence, this document will have two revisions branches: 1-abc, 2-def and 1-abc, 2-xyz, 3-ghi . Sharing In the sharing protocol , we implement this behaviour as we follow the CouchDB replication model. However, we prevent CouchDB conflicts for files and directories: see this explanation CouchDB performances \u00b6 Here is a benchmark performed on a CouchDB 2.3, running on a Thinkpad T480, i7-8550U , 16 Go RAM with 256Go SSD. The document insertion is performed in bulk, by batch of 100K documents maximum. Each doc has the following structure: { \"_id\" : \"xxx\" , \"_rev\" : \"yyy\" , \"count1\" : x , \"count2\" : x } count1 is indexed by a Mango index and a JavaScript view, while count2 is indexed by an Erlang view. Both of those fields are incremented at each document insertion. Each query is paginated to retrieve 100 documents at a time. We measured the time taken for each query, to see variations depending on the database volumetry. To measure the mango and views build time, we performed a single query just after their creation. \u2139\ufe0f The X and Y axis are logarithmic.

An index is a way to organize documents in order to retrieve them faster. To give a simple and non-database comparison, a recipe book might have an index listing all the recipes by their name with their page number. If the reader is looking for a particular recipe, this index avoids him to scan the full book to find it. The principle is the same for databases index: we want to avoid scanning the whole database each time we are looking for specific data expressed by a selector: even though computers are way faster than humans to scan data, this task can be very time-consuming when dealing with thousands or millions of documents. In more formal terms, time complexity of a query run on a database with n documents will be O(n) without index, as it requires to scan all documents. In CouchDB, the indexes are actually B+ Trees , a structure derived from the B-Trees , that perform in O(log(n)) in average, which guarantees a very fast access time even in large datasets. From a practical point of view, B-trees, therefore, guarantee an access time of less than 10 ms even for extremely large datasets. \u2014Dr. Rudolf Bayer, inventor of the B-tree", "title": "But why, though?"}, {"location": "tutorials/data/advanced/#b-tree", "text": "CouchDB indexes are B+ Trees. It means that indexed fields, here keys , are organized as a tree, with the documents stored in the leafs nodes. So, finding a particular document means browsing the tree, from the root to the leaf. In each node, a key has two children: the left child has all its keys inferior to the parent, while the right child has all its keys superior to the parent. In the Figure below, borrowed from the CouchDB guide , you see that each node has three keys. In CouchDB implementation, a B+ Tree node can actually store more than 1600 keys. B+ Tree This design is very efficient for range queries: in the example above, a query looking for documents having an indexed field between 1 and 3 will browse the tree to find the first document position (with a key of 1) and then get the next two contiguous documents. \u2139\ufe0f CouchDB has an append-only design: it means that there is no in-place update. Each time a document is updated, its new version is appended to the database file, and the B+ Tree is updated to reflect the change. \u2139\ufe0f It is not necessary to master the B+ Tree logic to query data, but it is good to at least be aware of the main concepts to understand the indexing logic, especially when designing complex queries. \u2139\ufe0f When indexing several document fields in the same index, the key is actually an array of those fields, e.g. an index on [\"category\", \"created_at\"] would give keys such as [\"sport\", \"2019-01-01\"] . \u2139\ufe0f A key does not have to be unique.

However, those documents will never be indexed, precisely because the field is missing. Hence, think carefully about your data before hand and do not use queries with $exists: false whenever possible. If a field is missing, it might be better to add a null value so that your documents do not have any missing fields. If this is not possible for some reasons, here is another possible solution - yet not very efficient: \u26a0\ufe0f Not efficient workaround const queryDef = client . find ( \"io.cozy.todos\" ) . where ({ _id : { $gt : null , }, category : { $exists : false , }, }) . indexFields ([ \"_id\" ]); Here, we force an index on the _id , which always exists in any CouchDB document, and ask all the documents with \"_id\": { \"$gt\": null } . The category is not indexed so the documents without this field will enter the index. This is not efficient as it implies that the \"category\": { \"$exists\": false } condition will be evaluated in memory by CouchDB for all the documents of the database, thus making a full index scan.", "title": "Indexes: why is my document not being retrieved?"}, {"location": "tutorials/data/advanced/#indexes-performances-and-design", "text": "When designing indexes on several fields, one should keep in mind that they are actually B+ Tree, as explained in this section . This can be helpful to design efficient queries and avoid performance traps. To illustrate this, let\u2019s assume you have declared this query, to get all the \u201cwork\u201d todos created in 2019: const queryDef = client . find ( \"io.cozy.todos\" ) . where ({ created_at : { $ge : \"2019-01-01\" , $lt : \"2020-01-01\" , }, category : \"work\" , }) . indexFields ([ \"created_at\" , \"category\" ]); \u26a0\ufe0f This query is actually sub-optimal. To understand this, let\u2019s represent some sample data: created_at category 2019-01-01 family 2019-01-01 sport 2019-01-01 work 2019-01-01 work 2019-01-02 work 2019-01-03 sport 2019-01-04 work \u2026 \u2026 2020-01-01 family This shows how the data is organized in the index: it is primarily sorted by created_at and then by category . First, the query is looking for all the todos starting from \"2019-01-01\" and before \"2020-01-01\" . It easily finds this range in the B+ Tree; but now it must also filter all the results to only keep the rows with category: work . And this cannot be done through the B+ Tree, because matching rows are not contiguous, as shown in green in the table: this means that CouchDB is forced to perform the category condition in memory, leading to bad performances. \ud83d\udca1 Hopefully, this example can be easily be solved by switching the index fields order: .indexFields([\"category\", \"created_at\"]) The data is now organized as follow: category created_at family 2019-01-01 ... ... sport 2019-01-01 ... ... work 2019-01-01 work 2019-01-01 work 2019-01-02 work 2019-01-03 work 2019-01-04 \u2026 \u2026 work 2020-01-01 Now, the very same query can be efficiently processed: the category: work is first evaluated in the B+ Tree, which return all the relevant rows, sorted by created_at . Then, the range is easily found now that all the rows are contiguous. \ud83d\udca1 The main takeaway here is: when dealing with a query with both equality and range, you must first index the equality field. If you are interested about this, you can learn more here . Even though it is SQL-oriented, it also applies for CouchDB as the B-Tree indexing logic is the same. \ud83d\udca1 When creating an index, carefully think about how your data will be organized and which query will need to perfom. The performances can dramatically vary depending on your design, with several orders of magnitude. \ud83d\udca1 The problematic and consequences of the not contiguous rows is further explain in the partial indexes section .", "title": "Indexes: performances and design"}, {"location": "tutorials/data/advanced/#partial-indexes", "text": "In CouchDB, a document is indexed only if its fields matches an existing index. As a consequence, it is not possible to perform efficient queries on non-existing fields.

Typically, queries with a non-egal operator, $ne : const queryDef = client . find ( \"io.cozy.todos\" ) . where ({ title : \"Exercices\" , category : { $ne : \"sport\" , }, }) . indexFields ([ \"title\" , \"category\" ]); As the $ne operator cannot guarantee contiguous rows, it needs to scan all the index on documents with the \"title\": \"Exercices\" to find those that are not in the sport category . Partial indexes are a way to circumvent this issue. They allow to define a partial selector condition that will be evaluated at the indexing time, and will add the document in the index if it matches the condition. Thanks to this, it becomes possible to tell CouchDB at indexing time to exlude documents that do not match the condition, e.g. \"category\": { \"$exists\": false} or \"category\": { \"$ne\": \"sport\"} . Hence, the produced index will only include documents that already matched the partial filter selector, making it possible to query them, as this selector enforces contiguous rows or documents with missing fields. You can declare a partial index in cozy-client like this: const queryDef = client . find ( \"io.cozy.todos\" ) . where ({ title : \"Exercices\" , }) . partialIndex ({ category : { $ne : \"sport\" , }, }) . indexFields ([ \"title\" ]); partialIndex supports the same syntax than the where , so you can easily move inefficient selectors into partial indexes.

Having a local database enables offline support and improves performances: the client can directly query local data to avoid network latency or unavailability. While it is meant to mimic most of the CouchDB API, there are specificities that are good to know when working with PouchDB. The findings below were obtained while working on sorting performance in Cozy Drive. For reference, the final PR can be seen here . Understanding what\u2019s going on \u00b6 Before diving into some of the quirks, it\u2019s important to understand some things when it comes to Pouchdb and especially Mango queries. First, you can add a plugin called pouchdb-debug and enable extra logs with PouchDB.debug.enable( \"pouchdb:find\" ); . This will add explanation about the queries you run in the console and it\u2019s very helpful to understand what\u2019s going on under the hood. You will realize that Pouchdb operates in 2 phases: first, it loads candidate documents in memory, and then it analyzes the candidates and only keeps the relevant ones. Long story short: the larger the number of candidates, the longer the operation will take. By default, all the documents in a database are candidates, but it is possible to have fewer candidates by using an index: by combining the query and the index, PouchDB can load only a subset of all the documents and may even skip the analyze phase if the index is really well suited to the query. A more detailed guide can be found here . About indexes \u00b6 Creating an index takes some time, but the first query will also take time \u2014 you are encouraged to warm up the indexes by firing a query that uses it before it is actually needed. CozyPouchLink provides a way to automatically fire those queries after replication. import fromPairs from 'lodash/fromPairs' import CozyClient , { Q } from 'cozy-client' import CozyStackClient from 'cozy-stack-client' import CozyPouchLink from 'cozy-pouch-link' const TRANSACTION_DOCTYPE = 'io.cozy.bank.operations' const makeWarmupQueryOptions = ( doctype , indexedFields ) => { return { definition : () => { const qdef = Q ( doctype ) . where ( fromPairs ( indexedFields . map ( fieldName => [ fieldName , { $gt : null }])) ) . indexFields ( indexedFields ) return qdef }, options : { as : ` ${ doctype } -by- ${ indexedFields . join ( '-' ) } ` } } } const pouchLink = new CozyPouchLink ({ doctypes : [ TRANSACTION_DOCTYPE ], doctypesReplicationOptions : { [ TRANSACTION_DOCTYPE ] : { warmupQueries : [ makeWarmupQueryOptions ( TRANSACTION_DOCTYPE , [ 'date' ]), makeWarmupQueryOptions ( TRANSACTION_DOCTYPE , [ 'account' ]), makeWarmupQueryOptions ( TRANSACTION_DOCTYPE , [ 'date' , 'account' ]) ] } }, initialSync : true }) const client = new CozyClient ({ links : [ pouchLink , new CozyStackClient ()] }) \u2139\ufe0f By default, Pouch will try to find the best index to use on your query. But for advanced queries, you generally want to force it with the use_index option to be sure it does not mess up. \u2139\ufe0f If the query and the index you force are not compatible, Pouch will emit an error and not run the query at all. \u2139\ufe0f If there is a change in the underlying documents, the index will be partially recalculated on the next query. Indexing more than one field \u00b6 Creating an index on several fields is not the same as creating multiple indexes on one field each. The effects of a single index on multiple fields is illustrated in the official docs and is important to understand. Furthermore, the order in which fields are indexed on a multi-index is significant, most notably when it comes to sorting. If you declare an index on the fields ['name', 'age'] , you should also sort them by ['name', 'age'] . Sorting them in a different order or using other fields will likely be done in memory and kill your performance. See this section for more details and understand how to efficiently design indexes. Avoiding full scan \u00b6 Filtering results with a selector on a field that has not been indexed is almost guaranteed to be done through a full scan and should be avoided. Since you can\u2019t have too many indexes, some filtering may have to be done in your own code \u2014 but if you can narrow down the results beforehand, that shouldn\u2019t be a problem.

This is a document-oriented NoSQL database, which means that data is represented as key-value JSON documents. A basic CouchDB document looks like this: { \"_id\" : \"6f978dbdc5e2424bfdec911f28005970\" , \"_rev\" : \"1-58b3a91cd89a6a2b607721f944bb6aeb\" , \"book\" : { \"name\" : \"The Greatest Book\" } } The _id and _rev fields are mandatory for each document and automatically handled by CouchDB, so the developers don\u2019t have to worry about them. _id is the unique identifier of the document while _rev is the version number, incremented for each update. See here to know more about the revision system. Any field can be specified in a CouchDB document (except for fields starting with a _ , that are reserved), as long as the JSON is valid and the type is supported , i.e. Array, Object, String, Number, Boolean. CouchDB comes with two query systems to retrieve documents: Mango queries , a declarative JSON syntax Views , to run arbitrary complex map-reduce functions In Cozy, we chose to support the simpler and more efficient Mango system by default, even though views are used in specific cases. \u2139\ufe0f CouchDB is an HTTP server. Therefore, all the requests made to the database must be expressed as HTTP requests. Any HTTP client can be used to directly query CouchDB ( curl , request , Insomnia to name a few). In Cozy, the back-end server, cozy-stack , communicates with CouchDB. \u2139\ufe0f In CouchDB, you organize data in DocTypes, a data structure meant to group documents together. All documents with the same DocType are stored in a dedicated database. Thus, each database has its own documents and indexes: when performing a query, one must indicates the target database; there is no cross-databases queries capability in CouchDB, altough there is a relationship query system to overcome this. See here for the DocTypes documentation. Mango queries \u00b6 The mango query system was introduced in CouchDB 2.0 and offers a declarative JSON syntax to perform queries on documents, inspired from MongoDB. There are several important concepts to grasp in order to efficiently use mango queries. Here, we give an overview of those concepts and detail common mistakes to avoid. Mango queries with cozy-client \u00b6 cozy-client is a JavaScript library developed by Cozy Cloud that helps to query data to the Cozy back-end, cozy-stack , without having to manually deal with authentication, index creation, pagination, etc. In the following, we provide cozy-client examples each time we introduce a new concept. If you are not familiar with it, this tutorial is a good starting place. However, if for some reasons you do not want to use cozy-client, it is possible to make queries on your own by directly requesting the cozy-stack data API . In cozy-client, each query is defined as a Query Definition . This API is helpful to easily chain Mango concepts (selectors, sorts, indexing, \u2026), as we will see in the following sections. In the following, we assume a DocType named io.cozy.todos describing Todo lists. Here is a basic example of a cozy-client query returning all the Todo lists in a Cozy: const docs = await client . queryAll ( Q ( \"io.cozy.todos\" )); In this example, the QueryDefinition defines the query to get all the documents stored in the Todos database, expressed through find(\"io.cozy.todos\") . Selectors \u00b6 To use the Mango query system, you define a selector , expressing criterias to filter the documents to return. Selectors with cozy-client \u00b6 With cozy-client, a selector is added to the query definition with the where method. It takes into input an object with the selector expression. For instance, this query means \u201cthe todos in \u2018sport\u2019 category AND a title \u2018Exercices\u2019\u201d: const queryDef = Q ( \"io.cozy.todos\" ). where ({ category : \"sport\" , title : \"Exercices\" , }); find targets the Todos database, while where filters the documents to return. \u2139\ufe0f When running this query, an index will automatically be created on the category and title fields. It is highly recommended to read the index section to avoid designing poorly efficient queries (see also the section on mango performances ). \u2139\ufe0f The $eq and $and operators are implicit by default. It allows to write concise queries. Here is the explicit version of the previous query: const queryDef = client . find ( \"io.cozy.todos\" ) . where ({ \"$and\" : [ { \"category\" : { \"$eq\" : \"sport\" }, { \"title\" : { \"$eq\" : \"Exercices\" } } ] }) Mango operators \u00b6 There are two kinds of mango operators: Condition operators ( $eq , $gt , $lt , \u2026) Combinaison operators ( $and , $or , $not , \u2026) For more details and examples of selectors, you can directly read the CouchDB documentation . Mango performances \u00b6 Depending on your queries and their complexity, performances can be dramatically impacted, by serveral orders of magnitude, especially for large databases, i.e. starting for thousands of documents. It is highly recommended to take some time to understand how to index fields and the related performances . Index fields \u00b6 In order to efficiently filter documents through selectors and sort them, it is important to correctly index data. An index is a way to organize documents in order to retrieve them faster. Most often, you will need to index fields to query data efficiently. Otherwise, the documents filtering will be processed by CouchDB through a full scan, i.e. fetching all the database documents and performing the selector in memory. This can be very time-consuming when the database grows. In some cases, it can even prevent the query to be run. Thus, when an index is required, any field involved in a selector should be indexed . \u2139\ufe0f It is not always necessary to index fields to filter data. For instance, let\u2019s assume you want all the folders inside a sub-folder, but not the trash (which is a special folder with a fixed _id ). You should index the type (to exclude files) and dir_id (to specifiy this specific sub-folder), but you should not index the _id (to exclude the trash): this can easily be done on the application level. Here, indexing _id would make the index grows unnecessarily and impact the database performances. \u26a0\ufe0f Maintaining a lot of indexes is costful for the database: you should think careful about your queries and re-use existing index when possible. \u26a0\ufe0f cozy-client automatically indexes fields declared in a where call. However, this currently only works for simple queries with implicit combinaison operators, i.e. where all the fields are declared at the first level of the object. For any query involving explicit operators, you can use the indexFields method, see below for an example. Here, we explain how you can index fields to efficiently query documents. If you are interested on why indexing is important and how your performances can dramatically vary, you can go to the advanced explanations here . With mango queries, it is required to index documents fields that are necessary to run the queries, either because they are involved in the selector or the sort. Index with cozy-client \u00b6 With cozy-client, you don\u2019t have to deal with the index creation: it is expressed through indexFields : const queryDef = client . find ( \"io.cozy.todos\" ) . where ({ category : \"sport\" , }) . indexFields ([ \"category\" ]); Thanks to this, cozy-client automatically creates an index on category before running the query for the first time and explicity tell CouchDB to use it. \ud83d\udca1 In this example, the indexField method is not mandatory: cozy-client is smart enough to automatically index category as it is involved in the selector. However, this automatic indexing only works for simple queries, thus, it is encouraged to explicity declare which fields to index. \u26a0\ufe0f CouchDB evaluates if a new document should be indexed by checking if its fields match an existing index. It means that all the indexed fields must exist in the document to index it. It can be problematic for queries that needs to check if a particular field exists or not. We detail this behaviour and workarounds in the \u201cwhy is my document not retrieved\u201d section . \u2139\ufe0f If no index is used to run the query, the query response will include a warning: no matching index found, create an index to optimize query time . It means that your index is not properly defined, probably because some fields involved in the where selector are not indexed. Note that if you use a sortBy , you also need to index the fields involved, as explained in this section . Index update \u00b6 CouchDB updates the Mango indexes when the data is read, but not on writes. This implies that if one creates an index and inserts documents, the index will never be updated until a find query on these documents is performed. \u26a0\ufe0f This implies that a query performed after many writes can take a certain time to complete, as it will update the index before returning any result. Likewise, the first query after an index creation will include the index build. Hence, developers should keep this behaviour in mind when designing applications and typically might need to handle query latency. \u2139\ufe0f Starting from CouchDB 3.0.0, a background indexing is implemented. It aims to avoid this latency by forcing the index to update in background after writes. Index with several fields \u00b6 Here is how to declare a query asking for todos having a \u201cwork\u201d category and have been created since 1st January 2019: const queryDef = client . find ( \"io.cozy.todos\" ) . where ({ \"$and\" : [ { \"created_at\" : { \"$gt\" : \"2019-01-01\" }, { \"category\" : \"work\" } ] }) . indexFields ([ \"category\" , \"created_at\" ]) \u26a0\ufe0f The order in the indexFields array can be very important for performances, especially when there are both range and equality operators: you must always index the field involved in the equality operator first. This is further explained in this section . Sort data with Mango \u00b6 It is possible to express the order of the documents returned by a query, by using the sort array. The sort is always done on a document field, by ascending ( asc ) or descending ( desc ) order. It is possible to specify several fields to sort, by following this structure for each field: {\"fieldName\": \"asc\"|\"desc\"} For instance: [{\"category\": \"asc\"}, {\"created_at\": \"asc\"}] Here, the returned documents will be first sorted by category, and then by creation date. \u26a0\ufe0f It is not possible to mix the sort order on different fields, i.e. all the fields involved in the sort must be either asc , either desc but not a mix of both. See this section for more info about the sort order on data types. Sort with cozy-client \u00b6 With cozy-client, a sort is expressed through the sortBy method. It takes as argument an array containing the fields to sort and the direction. For instance: const queryDef = client . find ( \"io.cozy.todos\" ) . where ({ category : \"sport\" , }) . indexFields ([ \"category\" , \"created_at\" ]). sortBy ([ ({ category : \"asc\" }, { created_at : \"asc\" }) ]); \u26a0\ufe0f If the fields involved in the sortBy are not indexed, this will force CouchDB to make the sort in memory: this can be acceptable if the query returns few documents, but it is not efficient for large queries. \u26a0\ufe0f At least one of the sort fields must be included in the where selector. If you create an index on category and query it to sort on it, but with no where selector, the index won\u2019t be used. \u26a0\ufe0f If several fields are indexed, their order is important: the sort order must follow the indexed fields order. In this example, we index category and created_at in this order: by doing so, it is not possible to sort only on created_at . We would need to index created_at first to achieve this, but this is not recommended for performances, as explained in this section . See also the examples provided in the PouchDB documentation . \u26a0\ufe0f Be aware that cozy-client sort documents too after a query using sortBy but, for now, with a different sorting logic than couchDB. See this cozy-client issue for more informations Pagination \u00b6 When dealing with queries returning a lot of documents, e.g. thousands, it might be necessary to paginate the results to avoid huge network payloads and having to load everything in memory, both on the server and client sides. The pagination consists of splitting the results in \u201cpages\u201d: if a query matches 100.000 documents, one can paginate it, for example by actually running 1000 queries returning 100 documents each. By doing so, the server only keeps 100 documents in memory for each query, and the client can control the data flow, for example, by implementing a \u201cLoad more\u201d button that actually runs a paginated query and loads the 100 next documents. With mango queries, the recommended method to paginate is through the bookmark parameter, that works exactly as it name suggests: it consists of a string returned by CouchDB that corresponds to the page position in the index. Just like an actual bookmark is used to mark a particular page in a book. With cozy-client, we can use the offsetBookmark method to paginate: const docs = []; let resp = { next : true }; while ( resp && resp . next ) { resp = await client . query ( Q ( \"io.cozy.todos\" ). limitBy ( 200 ). offsetBookmark ( resp . bookmark ) ); docs . push (... resp . data ); } \u2139\ufe0f By default, cozy-client has a limit of 100 documents per query, you can calibrate it thanks to the limitBy method. \u2139\ufe0f There is a hard limit per query enforced in the cozy-stack to avoid memory leaks. Currently, this limit is set to 1000 . \u2139\ufe0f The next parameter provided in the query response is handled by cozy-client and is set to true when it detects that there are more pages to fetch. Get them all! \u00b6 When pagination is not required by the client, cozy-client offers the queryAll method: const docs = await client . queryAll ( Q ( \"io.cozy.todos\" )); Note that it will actually automatically paginate if the total number of documents to return is superior to the limit (100 by default): this avoids loading too many documents in memory on the server side. However, it is possible to overcome this pagination by passing limit: null : in this case, cozy-client will request the _all_docs endpoint and retrieve all the documents in one query. This endpoint is automatically created by CouchDB and is actually a view on the _id key. Thus, doing this will actually query the _all_docs endpoint and return all the documents in one request: const docs = await client . query ( Q ( \"io.cozy.todos\" ), { limit : null }); \u26a0\ufe0f When querying this endpoint, the response includes the design docs , which are the Mango indexes and views definitions. Those documents are automatically filtered for the paginated queries. \u26a0\ufe0f This method is faster than the pagination as it avoids to make several server requests. However, if there are many documents to return, _all_docs queries can take a lot of time to complete and even timeout. It also consumes server resources. Hence, you should be cautious when using this route. Sort in CouchDB \u00b6 When dealing with various types of data, the ascending sort order is the following: null booleans numbers strings: \u201ca\u201d < \u201cA\u201d < \u201daa\u201d < \u201cb\u201d \u2026 arrays objects See the CouchDB documentation for more details on the sort orders. \u2139\ufe0f The sort order is the same for Mango queries and views. Comparison of strings \u00b6 Comparison of strings is done using ICU which implements the Unicode Collation Algorithm, giving a dictionary sorting of keys. This can give surprising results if you were expecting ASCII ordering. Note that: All symbols sort before numbers and letters (even the \u201chigh\u201d symbols like tilde, 0x7e ) Differing sequences of letters are compared without regard to case, so a < aa but also A < aa and a < AA Identical sequences of letters are compared with regard to case, with lowercase before uppercase, so a < A . Views \u00b6 \u26a0\ufe0f In Cozy, we disabled by default the possibility to create views from applications. Consequently, cozy-client does not support view creation, because they are disabled for applications. See the view performances section to find out why. CouchDB views are another way to express queries in Cozy, used by the cozy-stack . It consists of creating map-reduce functions, where the map is used to qualify which documents should be indexed, and the optional reduce can be used to compute aggregate functions on them. Views are much more flexible than Mango queries, as the map is a user-defined function (UDF) that can be written in JavaScript. For example: function ( doc ) { if ( doc . category && doc . created_at ) { emit ( doc . category , doc . created_at ); } } A map function must always produce an emit , with the key and the value respectively in first and second argument. \u2139\ufe0f Behind the hoods, views are represented exactly like the Mango queries: both use B+ Tree , with values stored in the leafs. Query a view \u00b6 Just like Mango queries, views are particularly suited for equality and range queries. See the CouchDB documentation to know more about the API. To find a specific document, use the key parameter: key=\"sport\" To find a range, combine the startkey and endkey parameters: startkey=\"category0001\"&endkey=\"category0009\" \u2139\ufe0f Note these queries return the values associated to their keys, as expressed by the emit in the map function. If the whole document is required, one can emit a null value, e.g. emit(doc.category, null) in the view definition and pass a include_docs: true when querying the view. Usage example: references \u00b6 The flexibility of the views can be useful is some specific scenarios and are used in some use-cases in cozy-stack. Typically, the references system implemented for the io.cozy.files documents allows to link other documents to a file. For example, a file can be referenced by a photo album, a bank transaction, etc. A reference looks like this, here a file referenced by two photos albums: \"referenced_by\" : [ { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.photos.albums\" , \"id\" : \"94375086-e2e2-11e6-81b9-5bc0b9dd4aa4\" }, { \"type\" : \"io.cozy.photos.albums\" , \"id\" : \"a7375980-cf29-0138-33fe-0c1645862fd7\" } ] This [n-n] relation is hard to express with a Mango query, so a view is defined: function ( doc ) { if ( isArray ( doc . referenced_by )) { for ( var i = 0 ; i < doc . referenced_by . length ; i ++ ) { emit ([ doc . referenced_by [ i ]. type , doc . referenced_by [ i ]. id ]); } } } Then, it is easy to get all the files referenced by a specific photo album: key=[\"io.cozy.photos.albums\", \"94375086-e2e2-11e6-81b9-5bc0b9dd4aa4\"]", "title": "Queries"}, {"location": "tutorials/data/queries/#queries", "text": "", "title": "Queries"}, {"location": "tutorials/data/queries/#basic-concepts", "text": "The database used in Cozy to store and manipulate data is CouchDB .

Here is the explicit version of the previous query: const queryDef = client . find ( \"io.cozy.todos\" ) . where ({ \"$and\" : [ { \"category\" : { \"$eq\" : \"sport\" }, { \"title\" : { \"$eq\" : \"Exercices\" } } ] })", "title": "Selectors with cozy-client"}, {"location": "tutorials/data/queries/#mango-operators", "text": "There are two kinds of mango operators: Condition operators ( $eq , $gt , $lt , \u2026) Combinaison operators ( $and , $or , $not , \u2026) For more details and examples of selectors, you can directly read the CouchDB documentation .", "title": "Mango operators"}, {"location": "tutorials/data/queries/#mango-performances", "text": "Depending on your queries and their complexity, performances can be dramatically impacted, by serveral orders of magnitude, especially for large databases, i.e. starting for thousands of documents.

An index is a way to organize documents in order to retrieve them faster. Most often, you will need to index fields to query data efficiently. Otherwise, the documents filtering will be processed by CouchDB through a full scan, i.e. fetching all the database documents and performing the selector in memory. This can be very time-consuming when the database grows. In some cases, it can even prevent the query to be run. Thus, when an index is required, any field involved in a selector should be indexed . \u2139\ufe0f It is not always necessary to index fields to filter data. For instance, let\u2019s assume you want all the folders inside a sub-folder, but not the trash (which is a special folder with a fixed _id ). You should index the type (to exclude files) and dir_id (to specifiy this specific sub-folder), but you should not index the _id (to exclude the trash): this can easily be done on the application level. Here, indexing _id would make the index grows unnecessarily and impact the database performances. \u26a0\ufe0f Maintaining a lot of indexes is costful for the database: you should think careful about your queries and re-use existing index when possible. \u26a0\ufe0f cozy-client automatically indexes fields declared in a where call. However, this currently only works for simple queries with implicit combinaison operators, i.e. where all the fields are declared at the first level of the object. For any query involving explicit operators, you can use the indexFields method, see below for an example. Here, we explain how you can index fields to efficiently query documents. If you are interested on why indexing is important and how your performances can dramatically vary, you can go to the advanced explanations here .

However, this automatic indexing only works for simple queries, thus, it is encouraged to explicity declare which fields to index. \u26a0\ufe0f CouchDB evaluates if a new document should be indexed by checking if its fields match an existing index. It means that all the indexed fields must exist in the document to index it. It can be problematic for queries that needs to check if a particular field exists or not. We detail this behaviour and workarounds in the \u201cwhy is my document not retrieved\u201d section . \u2139\ufe0f If no index is used to run the query, the query response will include a warning: no matching index found, create an index to optimize query time .

By doing so, the server only keeps 100 documents in memory for each query, and the client can control the data flow, for example, by implementing a \u201cLoad more\u201d button that actually runs a paginated query and loads the 100 next documents. With mango queries, the recommended method to paginate is through the bookmark parameter, that works exactly as it name suggests: it consists of a string returned by CouchDB that corresponds to the page position in the index. Just like an actual bookmark is used to mark a particular page in a book. With cozy-client, we can use the offsetBookmark method to paginate: const docs = []; let resp = { next : true }; while ( resp && resp . next ) { resp = await client . query ( Q ( \"io.cozy.todos\" ). limitBy ( 200 ). offsetBookmark ( resp . bookmark ) ); docs . push (... resp . data ); } \u2139\ufe0f By default, cozy-client has a limit of 100 documents per query, you can calibrate it thanks to the limitBy method. \u2139\ufe0f There is a hard limit per query enforced in the cozy-stack to avoid memory leaks.

However, it is possible to overcome this pagination by passing limit: null : in this case, cozy-client will request the _all_docs endpoint and retrieve all the documents in one query.

Now that we have successfully scraped and saved our data, the next step is to build the connector and send it to Cozy store !", "title": "Run the dev mode"}, {"location": "tutorials/konnector/scrape-data/", "text": "In this part, we are going to see how to scrape data from the service you want to retrieve your data from. If not done yet, you want to check the getting started guide . Implement your connector \u00b6 There are four steps for a connector to save data to Cozy Stack : authentication request data parse and format data save data to cozy stack You can see these steps in the src/index.js in the konnectors/template : async function start ( fields ) { // step 1. log ( 'info' , 'Authenticating ...' ) await authenticate ( fields . login , fields . password ) log ( 'info' , 'Successfully logged in' ) // step 2. // The BaseKonnector instance expects a Promise as return of the function log ( 'info' , 'Fetching the list of documents' ) const $ = await request ( ` ${ baseUrl } /index.html` ) // step 3. log ( 'info' , 'Parsing list of documents' ) const documents = await parseDocuments ( $ ) // step 4. // here we use the saveBills function even if what we fetch are not bills, but this is the most // common case in connectors log ( 'info' , 'Saving data to Cozy' ) await saveBills ( documents , fields . folderPath , { // this is a bank identifier which will be used to link bills to bank operations. These // identifiers should be at least a word found in the title of a bank operation related to this // bill. It is not case sensitive. identifiers : [ 'books' ] }) } Authentication \u00b6 Open the src/index.js file, there are comments to guide you through it. The very first step is to be able to authenticate to the remote service, this is done with the line: note: don\u2019t forget to add your additional fields if you have some. await authenticate ( fields . login , fields . password ) There are many obstacles at this level: is there a captcha? If yes you can take a look at our solveCaptcha API is there a 2FA? how is the <form> ? note: if the remote service exposes an API, you should use classical request call. Let\u2019s say the remote service exposes a simple classical form like https://www.trainline.eu/signin : < form id = \"signin-form\" novalidate = \"\" class = \"signin__form\" data-ember-action = \"\" data-ember-action-680 = \"680\" > < input name = \"email\" autocomplete = \"on\" placeholder = \"Email Address\" id = \"ember691\" class = \"ember-text-field textfield ember-view\" data-enpass . usermodified = \"yes\" type = \"email\" > < input name = \"password\" autocomplete = \"on\" placeholder = \"Password\" id = \"ember696\" class = \"ember-text-field textfield ember-view\" data-enpass . usermodified = \"yes\" type = \"password\" > < div class = \"signin__forgot\" > < span data-ember-action = \"\" data-ember-action-697 = \"697\" > < a href = \"/password\" id = \"ember698\" class = \"ember-view\" > Forgot your password? </ a > </ span > </ div > < div class = \"signin__buttons \" > < div class = \"signin__buttons-block\" > < button type = \"submit\" class = \"signin__button\" > Sign In </ button > </ div > </ div > </ form > Find a CSS selector for the form tag: form#signin-form . Find the name of the input tags used to host user\u2019s credentials: email and password . You are ready to complete the signin(options) object called in the authenticate(username, password) function: function authenticate ( username , password ) { return signin ({ url : `https://www.trainline.eu/signin` , formSelector : 'form#signin-form' , formData : { email : username , password }, validate : ( statusCode , $ ) => { // write some code to validate the form submission } }) } To implement the validate function, you need to check what is happening on a successful login and on an unsuccessful login. With the https://www.trainline.eu/signin example, fill the form with wrong credentials, open your browser\u2019s devtools (and check the network tab) and submit the form. Here it is clear, on incorrect credentials, the response have a status code 422 : HTTP/2.0 422 No Reason Phrase Do the same with valid credentials. HTTP/2.0 200 OK Then you can write a simple and straight forward validate code: function authenticate ( username , password ) { return signin ({ url : `https://www.trainline.eu/signin` , formSelector : 'form#signin-form' , formData : { email : username , password }, // \"email\" and \"password\" correspond to the `name` attribute of the HTML inputs validate : ( statusCode , $ ) => { return statusCode === 200 || log ( 'error' , 'Invalid credentials' ) } }) } However if the target website doesn\u2019t use statusCode correctly you can also use fullResponse.request.uri.href to check if there is a redirection to a page that requires to be logged in: validate : ( statusCode , $ , fullResponse ) => { return fullResponse . request . uri . href == 'https://example.com/account' || log ( 'error' , 'Invalid credentials' ) } It is also possible to use Cheerio to check if an HTML element is present in the web page or not : validate : ( statusCode , $ ) => { return $ ( 'a[href=\"https://example.com/logout\"]' ). length == 1 || log ( 'error' , $ ( '.error' ). text ()) } Request data \u00b6 Once the connector is able to be authenticated by the online service, the next step is to fetch data. The most common case is that the invoices we want to fetch are listed in a HTML page. So to request data, we fetch the target webpage that contains invoices list. But sometimes, the webpage is a JavaScript page that uses a JSON API URL. JSON is easier to parse than full HTML webpages. For the purpose of this guide, let\u2019s consider we are in the case of a full HTML webpage, like the service given as an example in the template: http://books.toscrape.com This is the easiest part, just fetch the webpage: const $ = await request ( 'http://books.toscrape.com/index.html' ) The $ variable is set to a cheerio object with useful API to crawl the webpage . You can name this variable as you want and create as many as you want Cheerio variables such as : $doc or $page . That object will be very useful for the next step. Parse the document \u00b6 We want to get every <article /> of the page in a JavaScript Array: const articles = []. map . call ( $ ( 'article' , node => node )) For every book, we want to catch the title attribute of this tag article h3 a . This is a CSS Selector that cheerio understands to select some part of the tree. In order to crawl a list of items to create an Array of JSON object, we can create our own function or use the function scrape from the connector libs : const docs = scrape ( $ , { title : { sel : 'h3 a' , attr : 'title' }, amount : { sel : '.price_color' , parse : normalizePrice }, url : { sel : 'h3 a' , attr : 'href' , parse : url => ` ${ baseUrl } / ${ url } ` }, fileurl : { sel : 'img' , attr : 'src' , parse : src => ` ${ baseUrl } / ${ src } ` }, filename : { sel : 'h3 a' , attr : 'title' , parse : title => ` ${ title } .jpg` } }, 'article' ) Keep in mind that there are many useful CSS Pseudo-classes and Combinators that you can use in your CSS selectors to help you select HTML elements. This code will loop on <article /> and for each item will create a JSON object with the selector sel and the value of attribute attr if specified, otherwise it takes the value of the child node, this value can be edited with the parse function. Here is a sample for the following markup from http://books.toscrape.com : < article class = \"product_pod\" > < div class = \"image_container\" > < a href = \"catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html\" > < img src = \"media/cache/2c/da/2cdad67c44b002e7ead0cc35693c0e8b.jpg\" alt = \"A Light in the Attic\" class = \"thumbnail\" > </ a > </ div > < p class = \"star-rating Three\" > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > < i class = \"icon-star\" ></ i > </ p > < h3 > < a href = \"catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html\" title = \"A Light in the Attic\" > A Light in the ... </ a > </ h3 > < div class = \"product_price\" > < p class = \"price_color\" > \u00a351.77 </ p > < p class = \"instock availability\" > < i class = \"icon-ok\" ></ i > In stock </ p > < form > < button type = \"submit\" class = \"btn btn-primary btn-block\" data-loading-text = \"Adding...\" > Add to basket </ button > </ form > </ div > </ article > And we will get the following JSON object: { \"title\" : \"A Light in the Attic\" , \"amount\" : 51.77 , \"url\" : \"http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html\" , \"fileurl\" : \"http://books.toscrape.com/media/cache/2c/da/2cdad67c44b002e7ead0cc35693c0e8b.jpg\" , \"filename\" : \"A Light in the Attic.jpg\" } The code sample includes some other function to manipulate the result object, but we have the idea. Once we build a correct object, we can save it to Cozy Stack. fileurl is used to tell Cozy where to find the file (here an image) to retreive. Then you can save it to Cozy Stack (see section below). There are many document types (Doctypes) you can store in your Cozy, such as: Bills Contacts Bank and so on\u2026 Save data to Cozy Stack \u00b6 In the example we use some built-in function to save a bill to the Cozy Stack. But there is a bunch of functions available depending on what you want: addData hydrateAndFilter saveBills to save invoices files (this function use saveFiles ) that can be linked to your bank transactions. saveFiles to upload files to Cozy Drive. and so on\u2026 For example, to save bills to Cozy you have to start by recovering all required fields for a data type io.cozy.bills using the scrape function, and then you can use the function saveBills to save your docs to Cozy Stack as shown below: await saveBills ( documents , fields , { idenditifiers: [ 'vendor' ], // name of the target website contentType: 'application/pdf' }) documents is the list of bills returned by the function parseDocuments after the page scraping .

For example, when you share documents to another cozy, the recipient of the sharing will be notified by email. For cozy-stack to be able to send email, it must be configured to know how to join a mail transport agent to send email. Mail transport agent (MTA) \u00b6 First, you need a mail transport agent (SMTP server) for sending mail. You can use either a local mail transport agent on the local server running cozy-stack, a remote mail transport agent on another server you manage or register for a mail sending service offering SMTP relay service. In all cases, you will need the following information: SMTP host SMTP port Encryption to use. Either plain SMTP (no encryption), STARTTLS over SMTP or SMTP over TLS/SSL In case you need authentication, you will also need username and password SMTP local name to use when talking to SMTP server (usually you server\u2019s Fully qualified domain name) Warning When using a local mail transport agent, be sure that your hosting provider let your server send outgoing emails. This is usually disabled by your hosting provider by default and should be enabled to let email get out of your server. Refer to your hosting provider documentation on how to allow outgoing email. Installing a local MTA \u00b6 When installing a local Mail Transport Agent, we recommand using postfix. Other mail transport agent software are suitable too, but we will let you handle their configuration. sudo apt update && sudo apt install postfix When installing postfix, choose the following answers when asked for an outgoing only mail transport agent: Configuration type: Internet site System mail name: The Fully Qualified Domain name of your server Then configure postfix to only listen incoming connexions from local server: postconf inet_interfaces = loopback-only postconf mydestination = '$myhostname, localhost.localdomain, localhost' systemctl restart postfix Configuring cozy-stack \u00b6 Mail sending configuration should ba added at the end of the /etc/cozy/cozy.yml.local configuration file. Its content depends on the encryption cozy-stack will use to talk to you mail transport agent. While encryption is not required when running cozy-stack and a local MTA on the same server, we recommend to encrypt communication between cozy-stack and a remote MTA. Below are some examples of mail configuration for cozy-stack. Choose one, copy it at the end of the /etc/cozy/.cozy.yml.local file and adapt it to your needs Local MTA on port 25 (SMTP), no encryption, no authentication \u00b6 This is the default configuration when no mail configuration has been done starting from cozy-stack version 1.6.15 mail : host : localhost port : 25 # No encryption disable_tls : true Remote MTA on submission port using STARTTLS and authentication \u00b6 mail : host : smtp.domain.example port : 587 # Authentication username : myusername password : P@ssword # Use STARTTLS, not native TLS/SSL disable_tls : false use_ssl : false skip_certificate_validation : false # Hostname sent to the SMTP server with the HELO command local_name : myserver.domain.example Remote MTA on submissions port using native TLS/SSL and authentication \u00b6 mail : host : smtp.domain.example port : 465 # Authentication username : myusername password : P@ssword # Use Native TLS/SSL disable_tls : false use_ssl : true skip_certificate_validation : false # Hostname sent to the SMTP server with the HELO command local_name : myserver.domain.example Restarting cozy-stack to use new configuration \u00b6 Don\u2019t forget to restart cozy-stack after having modified cozy.yml.local systemctl restart cozy-stack Index ^", "title": "Configure mail sending"}, {"location": "tutorials/selfhosting/administration/mail/#configuring-cozy-stack-to-send-mail", "text": "Sometimes, cozy-stack needs to send mail.

This guide will help you selfhost your Cozy inside docker with docker-compose. Requirements \u00b6 First you need a working docker installation with compose plugin. Plense refer to official Docker installation guide for detailed instructions. If you don\u2019t work as root, add your unpriviledged user to the docker group. Refer to docker documentation on how to manage docker as a non-root user Note docker-compose comes in two flavor. The first, v1, is a serapate python executable called docker-compose , the second, v2, is a plugin to the docker command called with docker compose (with a space instead of a dash between docker and compose ). In this documentation, we will use the newer docker compose version. If you still use the old separate executable, remplace all docker compose occurences with docker-compose You also need a domain name or a subdomain under which all your cozy instances will reside.

Configure your domain to point to your server in your domain\u2019s DNS: @ IN A <your server IP> * IN A <your server IP> If you prefer tu use a subdomain of your main domain, in case you use it for anything else, simply create DNS entries pointing to your server for that subdomain. For exmaple if you want all your instances to be located under the cozy subdomain of your domain.example domain, you need to add a wildcard dns entry to your server like this: cozy IN A <your server IP> *.cozy IN A <your server IP> Clone cozy-stack docker-compose repository \u00b6 sudo git clone https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack-compose.git /opt/cozy sudo chown -R ` whoami ` : /opt/cozy Configuration \u00b6 Copy the configuration file env.template file to .env cd /opt/cozy cp env.example .env and edit this .env file to configure your environment. You should at least edit the following variables: DOMAIN : The domain under which all your instances will be served. In our example, it\u2019s domain.example or cozy.domain.example if you use a subdomain. ACME_EMAIL : The email under which you want the TLS certificates to be issued with Let\u2019s Encrypt COUCHDB_PASSWORD : Generate and define a strong password for cozy-stack to connect to CouchDB COZY_ADMIN_PASSPHRASE : The cozy-stack administrative password.

You can execute any cozy-stack command by simply replacing cozy-stack with ./cozy-stack.sh For example: cd /opt/cozy ./cozy-stack.sh status To create your first instance: cd /opt/cozy ./cozy-stack.sh instances add \\ --apps home,banks,contacts,drive,notes,passwords,photos,settings,store \\ --email \"your.email@domain.example\" \\ --locale fr \\ --tz \"Europe/Paris\" \\ --passphrase YourStrongP@ssw0rd \\ myinstance.domain.example And then direct your browser to https://myinstance.domain.example .
